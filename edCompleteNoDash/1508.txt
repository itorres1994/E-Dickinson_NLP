1508

You cannot make 
Remembrance grow 
When it has lost its 
Root  
The tightening the 
Soil around 
And setting it upright 
Deceives perhaps the 
Universe 
But not retrieves the 
Plant  
Real 
Memory, like 
Cedar 
Feet 
Is shod with 
Adamant  
Nor can you cut 
Remembrance down 
When it shall once have grown  
Its 
Iron 
Buds will sprout anew 
However overthrown
