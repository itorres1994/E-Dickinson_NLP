216

Safe in their 
Alabaster 
Chambers  
Untouched my 
Morning 
And untouched by 
Noon  
Sleep the meek members of the 
Resurrection Rafter of satin, 
And 
Roof of stone.
Light laughs the breeze 
In her 
Castle above them  
Babbles the 
Bee in a stolid 
Ear, 
Pipe the 
Sweet 
Birds in ignorant cadence  
Ah, what sagacity perished here!
