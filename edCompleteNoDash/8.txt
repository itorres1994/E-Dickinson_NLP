There is a word 
Which bears a sword 
Can pierce an armed man  
It hurls its barbed syllables 
And is mute again  
But where it fell 
The saved will tell 
On patriotic day, 
Some epauletted 
Brother 
Gave his breath away.
Wherever runs the breathless sun  
Wherever roams the day  
There is its noiseless onset  
There is its victory! 
Behold the keenest marksman! 
The most accomplished shot! 
Time's sublimest target 
Is a soul "forgot!"
