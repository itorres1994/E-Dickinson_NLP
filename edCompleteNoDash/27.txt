Morns like these  we parted  
Noons like these  she rose  
Fluttering first  then firmer 
To her fair repose.
Never did she lisp it  
It was not for me  
She  was mute from transport  I  from agony Till  the evening nearing 
One the curtains drew  
Quick! 
A 
Sharper rustling! 
And this linnet flew!
