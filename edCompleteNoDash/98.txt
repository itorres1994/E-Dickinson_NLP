One dignity delays for all  
One mitred 
Afternoon  
None can avoid this purple  
None evade this Crown!
Coach, it insures, and footmen  
Chamber, and state, and throng  
Bells, also, in the village 
As we ride grand along!
What dignified 
Attendants! 
What service when we pause! 
How loyally at parting 
Their hundred hats they raise!
Her pomp surpassing ermine 
When simple 
You, and 
I, 
Present our meek escutcheon 
And claim the rank to die!
