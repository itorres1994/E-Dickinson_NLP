what mystery pervades a well  
that water lives so far  
a neighbor from another world 
residing in a jar
whose limit none have ever seen  
but just his lid of glass  
like looking every time you please 
in an abyss's face 
the grass does not appear afraid  i often wonder he 
can stand so close and look so bold 
at what is awe to me 
related somehow they may be  
the sedge stands next the sea  
where he is floorless 
and does no timidity betray
but nature is a stranger yet  
the ones that cite her most 
have never passed her haunted house  
nor simplified her ghost 
to pity those that know her not 
is helped by the regret 
that those who know her  know her less 
the nearer her they get
