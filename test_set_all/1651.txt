a 
word made 
flesh is seldom 
and tremblingly partook 
nor then perhaps reported 
but have i not mistook 
each one of us has tasted 
with ecstasies of stealth 
the very food debated 
to our specific strength a 
word that breathes distinctly 
has not the power to die 
cohesive as the 
spirit 
it may expire if 
he   
made 
flesh and dwelt among us  
could condescension be 
like this consent of 
language 
this loved philology
