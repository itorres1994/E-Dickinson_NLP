1576

the 
spirit lasts  but in what mode  
below  the 
body speaks  
but as the 
spirit furnishes  
apart  it never talks  
the 
music in the 
violin 
does not emerge alone 
but 
arm in 
arm with 
touch  yet 
touch 
alone  is not a 
tune  
the 
spirit lurks within the 
flesh 
like 
tides within the 
sea 
that make the 
water live  estranged 
what would the 
either be  
does that know  now  or does it cease  
that which to this is done  
resuming at a mutual date 
with every future one  
instinct pursues the 
adamant  
exacting this 
reply  
adversity if it may be  or 
wild 
prosperity  
the 
rumor's 
gate was shut so tight 
before my 
mind was sown  
not even a 
prognostic's 
push 
could make a 
dent thereon
