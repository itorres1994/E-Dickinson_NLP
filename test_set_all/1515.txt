the 
things that never can come back  are several  
childhood  some forms of 
hope  the 
dead  
though 
joys  like 
men  may sometimes make a 
journey  
and still abide  
we do not mourn for 
traveler  or 
sailor  
their 
routes are fair  
but think enlarged of all that they will tell us 
returning here   
here   
there are typic  
heres   
foretold 
locations  
the 
spirit does not stand  
himself  at whatsoever 
fathom 
his 
native 
land
