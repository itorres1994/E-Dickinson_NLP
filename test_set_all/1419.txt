1419

it was a quiet seeming 
day  
there was no harm in earth or sky  
till with the closing sun 
there strayed an accidental 
red 
a 
strolling 
hue  one would have said 
to westward of the 
town but when the 
earth began to jar 
and 
houses vanished with a roar 
and 
human 
nature hid 
we comprehended by the 
awe 
as those that 
dissolution saw 
the 
poppy in the cloud
