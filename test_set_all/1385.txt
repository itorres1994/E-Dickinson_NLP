 secrets  is a daily word 
yet does not exist  
muffled  it remits surmise  
murmured  it has ceased  
dungeoned in the 
human 
breast 
doubtless secrets lie  
but that 
grate inviolate  
goes nor comes away 
nothing with a 
tongue or 
ear  
secrets stapled there 
will emerge but once  and dumb  
to the 
sepulchre
