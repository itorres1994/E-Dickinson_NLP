not with a 
club  the 
heart is broken 
nor with a 
stone  
a 
whip so small you could not see it 
i've known
to lash the 
magic 
creature 
till it fell  
yet that 
whip's 
name 
too noble then to tell 
magnanimous as 
bird 
by 
boy descried  
singing unto the 
stone 
of which it died shame need not crouch 
in such an 
earth as 
ours  
shame  stand erect the 
universe is yours
