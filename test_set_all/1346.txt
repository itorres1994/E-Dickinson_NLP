as 
summer into 
autumn slips 
and yet we sooner say  
the 
summer  than  the 
autumn   lest 
we turn the sun away 
and almost count it an 
affront 
the presence to concede 
of one however lovely  not 
the one that we have loved so we evade the charge of 
years 
on one attempting shy 
the 
circumvention of the 
shaft 
of 
life's declivity
