1748

the reticent volcano keeps 
his never slumbering plan  
confided are his projects pink 
to no precarious man 
if nature will not tell the tale 
jehovah told to her 
can human nature not survive 
without a listener 
admonished by her buckled lips 
let every babbler be 
the only secret people keep 
is immortality
