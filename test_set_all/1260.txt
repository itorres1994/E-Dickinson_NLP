because that you are going 
and never coming back 
and 
i  however absolute  
may overlook your 
track because that 
death is final  
however first it be  
this instant be suspended 
above 
mortality significance that each has lived 
the other to detect 
discovery not 
god himself 
could now annihilate
eternity  
presumption 
the instant i perceive 
that you  who were 
existence 
yourself forgot to live the  
life that is  will then have been 
a thing i never knew  
as 
paradise fictitious 
until the 
realm of you the  
life that is to be   to me  
a 
residence too plain 
unless in my 
redeemer's 
face i recognize your own of 
immortality who doubts 
he may exchange with me 
curtailed by your obscuring 
face 
of everything but 
he of 
heaven and 
hell i also yield 
the 
right to reprehend 
to whoso would commute this 
face 
for his less priceless friend 
if  
god is 
love  as he admits 
we think that he must be 
because he is a  jealous 
god  
he tells us certainly
if  
all is possible with  him 
as he besides concedes 
he will refund us finally 
our confiscated 
gods
