1575

the 
bat is dun with wrinkled 
wings like fallow 
article  
and not a song pervade his 
lips  
or none perceptible
his small 
umbrella quaintly halved 
describing in the 
air 
an 
arc alike inscrutable 
elate philosopher
deputed from what 
firmament  
of what 
astute 
abode  
empowered with what 
malignity 
auspiciously withheld to his adroit 
creator 
acribe no less the praise  
beneficent believe me 
his 
eccentricities
