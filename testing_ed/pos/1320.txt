dear 
march  
come in  
how glad i am  i hoped for you before put down your 
hat  
you must have walked  
how out of 
breath you are  
dear 
march 
come right up the stairs with me  i have so much to tell i got your 
letter and the 
birds  
the 
maples never knew that you were coming  till i called i declare  how 
red their 
faces grew  
but 
march forgive me  and 
all those 
hills you left for me to 
hue  
there was no 
purple suitable  
you took it all with you who knocks 
that 
april 
lock the 
door  i will not be pursued  
he stayed away a 
year to call 
when i am occupied  
but trifles look so trivial 
as soon as you have come
that 
blame is just as dear as 
praise 
and 
praise as mere as 
blame
