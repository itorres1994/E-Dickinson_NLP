1628

a 
drunkard cannot meet a 
cork 
without a 
revery  
and so encountering a 
fly 
this 
january 
day 
jamaicas of 
remembrance stir 
that send me reeling in  
the moderate drinker of 
delight 
does not deserve the spring  
of juleps part are the 
jug 
and more are in the joy  
your connoisseur in 
liquours 
consults the 
bumble 
bee
