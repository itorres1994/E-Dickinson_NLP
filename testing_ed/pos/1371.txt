how fits his 
umber 
coat 
the 
tailor of the 
nut 
combined without a seam 
like 
raiment of a 
dream who spun the 
auburn 
cloth 
computed how the girth 
the 
chestnut aged grows 
in those primeval 
clothes we know that we are wise  
accomplished in 
surprise  
yet by this 
countryman  
this nature  how undone
