i suppose the time will come 
aid it in the coming 
when the 
bird will crowd the 
tree 
and the 
bee be booming
i suppose the time will come 
hinder it a little 
when the 
corn in 
silk will dress 
and in 
chintz the apple
i believe the 
day will be 
when the 
jay will giggle 
at his new white 
house the 
earth 
that too halt a little
