how lonesome the 
wind must feel 
nights  
when people have put out the 
lights 
and everything that has an 
inn 
closes the shutter and goes in how pompous the 
wind must feel 
noons 
stepping to incorporeal 
tunes 
correcting errors of the sky 
and clarifying scenery
how mighty the 
wind must feel 
morns 
encamping on a thousand dawns 
espousing each and spurning all 
then soaring to his 
temple 
tall
