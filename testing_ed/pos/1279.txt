the 
way to know the 
bobolink 
from every other 
bird 
precisely as the 
joy of him  
obliged to be inferred
of impudent 
habiliment 
attired to defy 
impertinence subordinate 
at times to 
majesty 
of 
sentiments seditious 
amenable to 
law  
as 
heresies of 
transport 
or 
puck's apostacy
extrinsic to 
attention 
too intimate with 
joy  
he compliments existence 
until allured away
by 
seasons or his 
children  
adult and urgent grown  
or unforeseen aggrandizement 
or happily 
renown by 
contrast certifying 
the 
bird of 
birds is gone  
how nullified the 
meadow  
her 
sorcerer withdrawn
