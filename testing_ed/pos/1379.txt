1379

his 
mansion in the 
pool 
the 
frog forsakes  
he rises on a 
log 
and statements makes  
his 
auditors two 
worlds 
deducting me  
the 
orator of 
april 
is hoarse 
today  
his 
mittens at his 
feet 
no 
hand hath he  
his eloquence a 
bubble 
as 
fame should be  
applaud him to discover 
to your chagrin 
demosthenes has vanished 
in 
waters 
green
