1736
 
proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it 
proud of the pain i did not feel till thee 
proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it 
not to partake thy passion my humility 
thou can'st not boast like 
jesus drunken without companion 
was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the 
nazarene 
thou can'st not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture 
see i usurped thy crucifix to honor mine
