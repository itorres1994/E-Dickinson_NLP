one 
joy of so much anguish 
sweet nature has for me i shun it as i do 
despair 
or dear iniquity  
why 
birds a 
summer morning 
before the 
quick of 
day 
should stab my ravished spirit 
with 
dirks of 
melody 
is part of an inquiry 
that will receive reply 
when 
flesh and 
spirit sunder 
in 
death's 
immediately
