1437

a 
dew sufficed itself  
and satisfied a 
leaf 
and felt how vast a destiny  
how trivial is 
life 
the 
sun went out to work  
the 
day went out to play 
and not again that 
dew be seen 
by physiognomy
whether by 
day 
abducted 
or emptied by the 
sun 
into the 
sea in passing 
eternally unknown
attested to this 
day 
that awful 
tragedy 
by 
transport's instability 
and 
doom's celerity
