not any more to be lacked  
not any more to be known  
denizen of 
significance 
for a span so worn even 
nature herself 
has forgot it is there  
sedulous of her 
multitudes 
notwithstanding 
despair of the 
ones that pursued it 
suing it not to go 
some have solaced the longing 
to accompany some  rescinded the 
wrench  
others  
shall i say 
plated the residue of 
adz 
with monotony
