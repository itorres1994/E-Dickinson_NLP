those cattle smaller than a 
bee 
that herd upon the eye  
whose tillage is the passing 
crumb  
those 
cattle are the 
fly  
of 
barns for

extemporaneous stalls 
they found to our objection  
on eligible walls  
reserving the presumption 
to suddenly descend 
and gallop on the 
furniture  
or odiouser offend  
of their peculiar calling 
unqualified to judge 
to 
nature we remand them 
to justify or scourge
