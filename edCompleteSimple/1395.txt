after all 
birds have been investigated and laid aside  
nature imparts the little 
bluebird  assured 
her conscientious 
voice will soar unmoved 
above ostensible vicissitude
first at the 
march  competing with the 
wind her panting note exalts us  like a friend  
last to adhere when 
summer cleaves away  
elegy of integrity
