ah 
moon  and 
star 
you are very far  
but were no one 
farther than you  
do you think 
i'd stop 
for a 
firmament  
or a 
cubit  or so
i could borrow a 
bonnet 
of the 
lark  
and a 
chamois' 
silver 
boot  
and a stirrup of an 
antelope  
and be with you  tonight
but 
moon and 
star 
though you're very far  
there is one  farther than you  
he  is more than a firmament  from 
me  
so i can never go
