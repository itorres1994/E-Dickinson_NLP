915

faith  is the 
pierless 
bridge 
supporting what 
we see 
unto the 
scene that 
we do not  
too slender for the eye
it bears the 
soul as bold 
as it were rocked in 
steel 
with 
arms of 
steel at either side  
it joins  behind the 
veil 
to what could 
we presume 
the 
bridge would cease to be 
to 
our far vacillating 
feet 
a first necessity
