how sick  to wait  in any place  but thine  i knew last night  when someone tried to twine  
thinking  perhaps  that i looked tired  or alone  
or breaking  almost  with unspoken pain and i turned  ducal  
that right  was thine  
one port  suffices  for a 
brig  like mine ours be the tossing  wild though the sea  
rather than a 
mooring  unshared by thee 
ours be the 
cargo  unladed  here  
rather than the spicy isles  
and thou  not there
