188

make me a picture of the sun  
so i can hang it in my room  
and make believe 
i'm getting warm 
when others call it 
daydraw me a 
robin  on a stem  
so i am hearing him 
i'll dream 
and when the 
orchards stop their tune  
put my pretense  away say if it's really  warm at noon  
whether it's 
buttercups  that skim  
or 
butterflies  that bloom 
then  skip  the frost  upon the lea  
and skip the 
russet  on the tree  
let's play those  never come
