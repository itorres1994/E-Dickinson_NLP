1558

of 
death i try to think like this  
the 
well in which they lay us 
is but the 
likeness of the 
brook 
that menaced not to slay us  
but to invite by that 
dismay 
which is the 
zest of sweetness 
to the same 
flower 
hesperian  
decoying but to greet us i do remember when a 
child 
with bolder 
playmates straying 
to where a 
brook that seemed a 
sea 
withheld us by its roaring 
from just the 
purple 
flower beyond 
until constrained to clutch it 
if 
doom itself were the result  
the boldest leaped  and clutched it
