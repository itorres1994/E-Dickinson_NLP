god is a distant  stately 
lover  
woos as 
he states us  by 
his 
son  
verily a 
vicarious 
courtship  
miles and 
priscilla were such an 
one but lest the 
soul  like fair 
priscilla 
choose the 
envoy  and spurn the 
groom  
vouches with hyperbolic archness 
miles and 
john 
alden were 
synonym
