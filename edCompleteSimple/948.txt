'twas 
crisis  
all the length had passed  
that dull  benumbing time 
there is in 
fever or 
event  
and now the 
chance had come the instant holding in its claw 
the privilege to live 
or warrant to report the 
soul 
the other side the grave
the 
muscles grappled as with leads 
that would not let the 
will  
the 
spirit shook the 
adamant  
but could not make it feel
the 
second poised  debated  shot  
another had begun  
and simultaneously a 
soul 
escaped the 
house unseen
