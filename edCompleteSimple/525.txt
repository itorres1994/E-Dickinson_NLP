i think the 
hemlock likes to stand 
upon a 
marge of 
snow  
it suits his own 
austerity  
and satisfies an awe
that men must slake in 
wilderness  
and in the 
desert  cloy  
an instinct for the 
hoar the 
bald  
lapland's  necessity the 
hemlock's nature thrives  on cold  
the 
gnash of 
northern winds 
is sweetest nutriment  to him  
his best 
norwegian 
wines to satin 
races  he is nought  
but 
children on the 
don 
beneath his 
tabernacles play 
and 
dnieper 
wrestlers run
