'tis not that 
dying hurts us so  '
tis 
living  hurts us more  
but 
dying  is a different way  
a 
kind behind the 
door the 
southern 
custom  of the 
bird  
that ere the 
frosts are due  
accepts a better 
latitude  
we  are the 
birds  that stay
the 
shrivers round 
farmers' doors  
for whose reluctant 
crumb  
we stipulate  till pitying 
snows 
persuade our 
feathers home
