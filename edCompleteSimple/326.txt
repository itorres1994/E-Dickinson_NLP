i cannot dance upon my 
toes  
no 
man instructed me  
but oftentimes among my mind 
a 
glee possesseth me
that had i 
ballet knowledge  
would put itself abroad 
in 
pirouette to blanch a 
troupe  
or lay a 
prima mad
and though i had no 
gown of 
gauze  
no 
ringlet to my 
hair 
nor hopped to 
audiences  like 
birds 
one 
claw upon the air
nor tossed my shape in 
eider 
balls 
nor rolled on wheels of snow 
till i was out of sight in sound 
the 
house encore me so nor any know i know the 
art i mention  easy  
here  
nor any 
placard boast me  
it's full as 
opera
