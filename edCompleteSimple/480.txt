why do i love 
you 
sir 
because  
the 
wind does not require the 
grass 
to answer  
wherefore when 
he pass 
she cannot keep 
her place
because 
he knows  and 
do not 
you  
and 
we know not  
enough for 
us 
the 
wisdom it be so the 
lightning  never asked an 
eye 
wherefore it shut  when 
he was by  
because 
he knows it cannot speak and reasons not contained   
of 
talk  
there be  preferred by 
daintier 
folk the 
sunrise  
sire  compelleth 
me  
because 
he's 
sunrise  and i see therefore  
then  i love 
thee
