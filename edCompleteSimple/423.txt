the 
months have ends  the 
years  a knot  
no 
power can untie 
to stretch a little further 
a 
skein of 
misery the 
earth lays back these tired lives 
in her mysterious 
drawers  
too tenderly that any doubt 
an ultimate 
repose the manner of the 
children  
who weary of the 
day  
themself  the noisy 
plaything 
they cannot put away
