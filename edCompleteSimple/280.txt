280

i felt a 
funeral in my 
brain 
and 
mourners to and fro 
kept treading  treading  till it seemed 
that 
sense was breaking through and when they all were seated 
a 
service like a 
drum  
kept beating  beating  till i thought 
my 
mind was going numb and then i heard them lift a 
box 
and creak across my 
soul 
with those same 
boots of 
lead again 
then 
space  began to toll
as all the 
heavens were a 
bell 
and 
being but an 
ear 
and 
i and 
silence some strange 
race 
wrecked solitary here  
and then a 
plank in 
reason broke 
and i dropped down and down  
and hit a 
world at every plunge 
and 
finished knowing  then
