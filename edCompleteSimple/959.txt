a loss of something ever felt i  
the first that i could recollect 
bereft i was  of what i knew not 
too young that any should suspect
a 
mourner walked among the children i notwithstanding went about 
as one bemoaning a 
dominion 
itself the only 
prince cast out  
elder 
today a session wiser 
and fainter too as 
wiseness is  i find myself still softly searching 
for my 
delinguent 
palaces and a 
suspicion like a 
finger 
touches my 
forehead now and then 
that i am looking oppositely 
for the site of the 
kingdom of 
heaven
