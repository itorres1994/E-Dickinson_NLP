as 
watchers hang upon the 
east 
as 
beggars revel at a feast 
by savory 
fancy spread  
as brooks in deserts babble sweet 
on ear too far for the delight 
heaven beguiles the tired
as that same watcher when the 
east 
opens the lid of 
amethyst 
and lets the morning go  
that 
beggar when an honored 
guest 
those thirsty lips to flagons pressed 
heaven to us if true
