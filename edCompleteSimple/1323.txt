1323

i never hear that one is dead 
without the chance of 
life 
afresh annihilating me 
that mightiest belief
too mighty for the 
daily mind 
that tilling its abyss 
had 
madness had it once or twice 
the yawning consciousness
beliefs are 
bandaged like the 
tongue 
when 
terror were it told 
in any 
tone commensurate 
would strike us instant dead
i do not know the man so bold 
he dare in lonely 
place 
that awful stranger 
consciousness 
deliberately face
