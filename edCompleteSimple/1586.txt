1586

to her derided 
home 
a 
weed of 
summer came  
she did not know her station low 
nor 
ignominy's 
name  
bestowed a summer long 
upon a frameless flower  
then swept as lightly from disdain 
as 
lady from her 
bower of 
bliss the 
codes are few  
as 
jesus cites of 
him  
come unto me the moiety 
that wafts the 
seraphim
