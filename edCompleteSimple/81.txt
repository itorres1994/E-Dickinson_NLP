we should not mind so small a flower  
except it quiet bring 
our little garden that we lost 
back to the 
lawn again
so spicy her 
carnations nod  
so drunken reel her 
bees  
so silver steal a hundred flutes 
from out a hundred trees that whoso sees this little flower 
by faith may clear behold 
the 
bobolinks around the throne 
and 
dandelions gold
