expanse cannot be lost  
not 
joy but a 
decree 
is 
deity  
his 
scene 
infinity  
whose rumor's 
gate was shut so tight 
before my 
beam was sown 
not even a 
prognostic's push 
could make a 
dent thereon the 
world that thou hast opened 
shuts for thee 
but not alone 
we all have followed thee  
escape more slowly 
to thy 
tracts of 
sheen  
the 
tent is listening 
but the 
troops are gone
