198

an awful 
tempest mashed the air the clouds were gaunt and few  
a 
black  as of a 
spectre's 
cloak 
hid 
heaven and 
earth from view
the creatures chuckled on the 
roofs  
and whistled in the air  
and shook their fists  
and gnashed their teeth  
and swung their frenzied hair
the morning lit  the 
birds arose the 
monster's faded eyes 
turned slowly to his native coast  
and peace  was paradise
