1465

before you thought of 
spring 
except as a 
surmise 
you see  
god bless his suddenness  
a 
fellow in the 
skies 
of independent 
hues 
a little weather worn 
inspiriting habiliments 
of 
indigo and 
brown  
with specimens of 
song 
as if for you to choose  
discretion in the interval 
with gay delays he goes 
to some superior 
tree 
without a single 
leaf 
and shouts for joy to 
nobody 
but his seraphic self
