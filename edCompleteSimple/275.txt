doubt 
me  
my 
dim 
companion  
why  
god  would be content 
with but a fraction of the 
life  
poured thee  without a stint  
the whole of me  forever  
what more the 
woman can  
say quick  that i may dower thee 
with last 
delight i own 
it cannot be my 
spirit  
for that was thine  before  i ceded all of 
dust i knew  
what 
opulence the more 
had i  a freckled 
maiden  
whose farthest of 
degree  
was  that she might  
some distant 
heaven  
dwell timidly  with thee 
sift her  from 
brow to 
barefoot  
strain till your last 
surmise  
drop  like a 
tapestry  away  
before the 
fire's 
eyes  
winnow her finest fondness  
but hallow just the snow 
intact  in 
everlasting flake  
oh  
caviler  for you
