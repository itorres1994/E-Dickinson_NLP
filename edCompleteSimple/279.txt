tie the 
strings to my 
life 
my 
lord 
then i am ready to go 
just a look at the 
horses  
rapid 
that will do
put me in on the firmest side  
so i shall never fall  
for we must ride to the 
judgment  
and it's partly down 
hill but never i mind the steeper  
and never i mind the 
sea  
held fast in 
everlasting 
race  
by my own 
choice and 
thee goodbye to the 
life i used to live  
and the 
world i used to know  
and kiss the 
hills for me just once then  i am ready to go
