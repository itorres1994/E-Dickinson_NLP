1068

further in 
summer than the 
birds 
pathetic from the 
grass 
a minor 
nation celebrates 
its unobtrusive mass
no 
ordinance be seen 
so gradual the 
grace 
a pensive 
custom it becomes 
enlarging loneliness
antiquest felt at 
noon 
when 
august burning low 
arise this spectral 
canticle 
repose to typify
remit as yet no 
grace 
no 
furrow on the 
glow 
yet a 
druidic 
difference 
enhances 
nature now
