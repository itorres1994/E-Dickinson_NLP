58

delayed till she had ceased to know  
delayed till in its vest of snow 
her loving bosom lay  
an hour behind the fleeting breath  
later by just an hour than 
death  
oh lagging yesterday
could she have guessed that it would be  
could but a crier of the joy 
have climbed the distant hill  
had not the bliss so slow a pace 
who knows but this surrendered face 
were undefeated still
oh if there may departing be 
any forgot by 
victory 
in her imperial round  
show them this meek appareled thing 
that could not stop to be a king  
doubtful if it be crowned
