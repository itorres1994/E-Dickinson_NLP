we pray  to 
heaven  
we prate  of 
heaven  
relate  when 
neighbors die  
at what o'clock to heaven  they fled  
who saw them  
wherefore fly 
is 
heaven a 
place  a 
sky  a 
tree  
location's narrow way is for 
ourselves  
unto the 
dead 
there's no 
geography but 
state  
endowal  
focus  
where  
omnipresence  fly
