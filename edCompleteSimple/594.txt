the 
battle fought between the 
soul 
and 
no 
man  is the 
one 
of all the 
battles prevalent  
by far the 
greater 
one no 
news of it is had abroad  
its 
bodiless 
campaign 
establishes and terminates  
invisible  
unknown nor 
history  record it  
as 
legions of a 
night 
the 
sunrise scatters  
these endure  
enact  and terminate
