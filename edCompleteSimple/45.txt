45

there's something quieter than sleep 
within this inner room 
it wears a sprig upon its breast  
and will not tell its name
some touch it and some kiss it  
some chafe its idle hand  
it has a simple gravity i do not understand
i would not weep if i were they  
how rude in one to sob 
might scare the quiet fairy 
back to her native wood 
while simplehearted neighbors 
chat of the 
early dead  
we  prone to periphrasis 
remark that 
birds have fled
