through the strait pass of suffering the 
martyrs  even  trod 
their feet  upon 
temptations  
their faces  upon 
god a stately  shriven  
company  
convulsion  playing round  
harmless  as streaks of 
meteor  
upon a 
planet's 
bond their faith  the everlasting troth  
their 
expectation  fair  
the 
needle  to the 
north 
degree  
wades  so  thro' polar 
air
