i read my sentence  steadily  
reviewed it with my eyes  
to see that i made no mistake 
in its extremest clause  
the 
date  and manner  of the shame  
and then the 
pious 
form 
that  
god have mercy  on the 
soul 
the 
jury voted 
him  i made my soul familiar  with her extremity  
that at the last  it should not be a novel 
agony  
but she  and 
death  acquainted  
meet tranquilly  as friends  
salute  and pass  without a 
hint  
and there  the 
matter ends
