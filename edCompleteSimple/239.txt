heaven   is what i cannot reach  
the 
apple on the 
tree  
provided it do hopeless  hang  
that   
heaven  is  to me 
the 
color  on the 
cruising 
cloud  
the interdicted 
land  
behind the 
hill  the 
house behind there  
paradise  is found 
her teasing 
purples  
afternoons the credulous  decoy  
enamored  of the 
conjuror  
that spurned us  yesterday
