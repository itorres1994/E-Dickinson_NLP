i had some things that i called mine  
and 
god that he called his 
till recently a rival 
claim 
disturbed these amities
the property my garden 
which having sown with care 
he claims the pretty acre 
and sends a 
bailiff there
the station of the parties 
forbids publicity 
but 
justice is sublimer 
than arms or pedigree
i'll institute an 
action  
i'll vindicate the law  
jove 
choose your counsel  i retain shaw
