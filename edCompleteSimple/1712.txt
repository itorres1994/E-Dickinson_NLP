a 
pit  but 
heaven over it  
and 
heaven beside and 
heaven abroad 
and yet a 
pit  
with 
heaven over it
to stir would be to slip to look would be to drop  
to dream  to sap the 
prop 
that holds my chances up 
ah 
pit 
with 
heaven over it
the depth is all my thought  i dare not ask my feet  '
twould start us where we sit 
so straight you'd scarce suspect 
it was a 
pit  with fathoms under it  
its 
circuit just the same 
seed  summer  tomb  
whose 
doom to whom
