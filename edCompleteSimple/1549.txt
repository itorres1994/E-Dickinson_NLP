1549

my 
wars are laid away in 
books  i have one 
battle more  
a 
foe whom i have never seen 
but oft has scanned me o'er  
and hesitated me between 
and others at my side 
but chose the best  
neglecting me  till 
all the rest have died  
how sweet if i am not forgot 
by 
chums that passed away  
since 
playmates at threescore and ten 
are such a scarcity
