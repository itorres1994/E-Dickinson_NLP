the spry 
arms of the 
wind 
if i could crawl between i have an errand imminent 
to an adjoining 
zone i should not care to stop 
my 
process is not long 
the 
wind could wait without the 
gate 
or stroll the 
town among
to ascertain the 
house 
and is the soul at 
home 
and hold the 
wick of mine to it 
to light and then return
