1670

in 
winter in my 
room i came upon a 
worm  
pink lank and warm  
but as he was a worm 
and worms presume 
not quite with him at home  
secured him by a string 
to something neighboring 
and went along
a 
trifle afterward 
a thing occurred 
i'd not believe it if i heard 
but state with creeping blood  
a snake with mottles rare 
surveyed my chamber floor 
in feature as the worm before 
but ringed with power the very string with which i tied him  too 
when he was mean and new 
that string was there i shrank  
how fair you are 
propitiation's claw  
afraid he hissed 
of me 
no cordiality  
he fathomed me  
then to a 
rhythm 
slim 
secreted in his 
form 
as 
patterns swim 
projected him
that time i flew 
both eyes his way 
lest he pursue 
nor ever ceased to run 
till in a distant 
town 
towns on from mine i set me down 
this was a dream
