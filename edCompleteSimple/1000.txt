the 
fingers of the 
light 
tapped soft upon the 
town 
with  
i am great and cannot wait 
so therefore let me in  
 you're soon   the 
town replied   
my 
faces are asleep  
but swear  and i will let you by  
you will not wake them up  
the easy 
guest complied 
but once within the 
town 
the transport of 
his 
countenance 
awakened 
maid and man
the 
neighbor in the 
pool 
upon 
his 
hip elate 
made loud obeisance and the 
gnat 
held up 
his 
cup for light
