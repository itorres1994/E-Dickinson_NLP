now i knew i lost her not that she was gone  
but 
remoteness travelled 
on her 
face and tongue
alien though adjoining 
as a 
foreign 
race  
traversed she though pausing 
latitudeless place
elements 
unaltered  
universe the same 
but 
love's transmigration  
somehow this had come henceforth to remember 
nature took the 
day i had paid so much for  
his is 
penury 
not who toils for 
freedom 
or for 
family 
but the 
restitution 
of idolatry
