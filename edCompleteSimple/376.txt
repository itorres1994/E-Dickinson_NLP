of 
course  i prayed  
and did 
god 
care 
he cared as much as on the 
air 
a 
bird  had stamped her foot  
and cried 
give 
me  
my 
reason  
life  i had not had  but for 
yourself  '
twere better 
charity 
to leave me in the 
atom's 
tomb  
merry and 
nought and gay and numb  
than this smart 
misery
