god made a little 
gentian  
it tried  to be a 
rose  
and failed  and all the 
summer laughed  
but just before the snows
there rose a 
purple 
creature  
that ravished all the 
hill  
and 
summer hid her 
forehead  
and 
mockery  was still the 
frosts were her condition  
the 
tyrian would not come 
until the 
north  invoke it  
creator  
shall i  bloom
