triumph  may be of several kinds  
there's 
triumph in the 
room 
when that 
old 
imperator  
death  
by faith be overcome
there's triumph of the finer mind
when truth affronted long
advance unmoved to her supreme
her god her only throng
a triumph when temptation's bride
be slowly handed back
one eye upon the heaven renounced
and one upon the rack
severer triumph by himself
experienced who pass
acquitted from that naked bar
jehovah's countenance
