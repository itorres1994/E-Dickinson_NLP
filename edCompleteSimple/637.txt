637

the child's faith is new —
whole — like his principle —
wide — like the sunrise
on fresh eyes —
never had a doubt —
laughs — at a scruple —
believes all sham
but paradise —

credits the world —
deems his dominion
broadest of sovereignties —
and caesar — mean —
in the comparison —
baseless emperor —
ruler of nought —
yet swaying all —

grown bye and bye
to hold mistaken
his pretty estimates
of prickly things
he gains the skill
sorrowful — as certain —
men — to anticipate
instead of kings —
