i know that 
he exists 
somewhere  in 
silence  
he has hid his rare life 
from our gross eyes'
tis an instant's play '
tis a fond 
ambush  
just to make 
bliss 
earn her own surprise
but  should the play 
prove piercing earnest should the glee  glaze  
in 
death's  stiff  stare would not the fun 
look too expensive 
would not the jest  
have crawled too far
