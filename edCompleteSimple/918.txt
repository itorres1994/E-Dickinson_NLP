only a 
shrine but 
mine  i made the 
taper shine  
madonna dim to whom all 
feet may come 
regard a 
nun thou knowest every 
woe  
needless to tell thee  so  
but can'st thou do 
the 
grace next to it  heal 
that looks a harder skill to us  
still  just as easy if it be thy 
will 
to thee  
grant me  
thou knowest though so 
why tell thee
