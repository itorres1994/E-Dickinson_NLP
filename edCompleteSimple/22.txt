all these my banners be i sow my pageantry 
in 
may  
it rises train by train  
then sleeps in state again  
my chancel  all the plain today
to lose  if one can find again  
to miss  if one shall meet  
the 
burglar cannot rob  then  
the 
broker cannot cheat 
so build the hillocks gaily 
thou little spade of mine 
leaving nooks for 
daisy 
and for 
columbine  
you and i the secret 
of the 
crocus know  
let us chant it softly  
there is no more snow
to him who keeps an 
orchis' heart the swamps are pink with 
june
