some keep the 
sabbath going to 
church  i keep it staying at 
home  
with a 
bobolink for a 
chorister  
and an 
orchard for a 
dome some keep the 
sabbath in 
surplice i just wear my 
wings  
and instead of tolling the 
bell for 
church 
our little 
sexton  sings
god preaches a noted 
clergyman  
and the sermon is never long 
so instead of getting to 
heaven at least  
i'm going all along
