i measure every 
grief i meet 
with narrow probing 
eyes  i wonder if 
it weighs like 
mine  
or has an 
easier size
i wonder if 
they bore it long  
or did it just begin  i could not tell the 
date of 
mine  
it feels so old a pain i wonder if it hurts to live  
and if 
they have to try  
and whether  could 
they choose between  
it would not be  to die i note that 
some  gone patient long  
at length renew their smile  
an imitation of a 
light 
that has so little 
oil i wonder if when 
years have piled  
some 
thousands  on the 
harm  
that hurt them early  such a lapse 
could give them any 
balm or would they go on aching still 
through 
centuries of 
nerve  
enlightened to a larger 
pain  
in 
contrast with the 
love the 
grieved  are many  i am told  
there is the various 
cause  
death  is but one  and comes but once  
and only nails the eyes there's 
grief of 
want  and 
grief of 
cold  
a sort they call 
despair  
there's 
banishment from native 
eyes  
in sight of 
native 
air and though i may not guess the kind  
correctly  yet to me 
a piercing 
comfort it affords 
in passing 
calvary to note the fashions  of the 
cross and how they're mostly worn  
still fascinated to presume 
that 
some  are like 
my 
own
