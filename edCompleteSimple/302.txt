like 
some 
old fashioned 
miracle 
when 
summertime is done  
seems 
summer's 
recollection 
and the 
affairs of 
june 
as infinite 
tradition 
as 
cinderella's 
bays  
or 
little 
john  of 
lincoln 
green  
or 
blue 
beard's 
galleries her 
bees have a fictitious 
hum  
her 
blossoms like a 
dream  
elate us  till we almost weep  
so plausible  they seem her 
memories like 
strains  
review  
when 
orchestra is dumb  
the 
violin in 
baize replaced  
and 
ear  and 
heaven  numb
