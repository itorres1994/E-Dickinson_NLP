the 
heart has narrow 
banks 
it measures like the 
sea 
in mighty  unremitting 
bass 
and 
blue monotony
till 
hurricane bisect 
and as itself discerns 
its sufficient 
area 
the 
heart convulsive learns
that 
calm is but a 
wall 
of unattempted 
gauze 
an instant's 
push demolishes 
a 
questioning  dissolves
