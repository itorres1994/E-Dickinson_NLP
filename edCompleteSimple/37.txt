37

before the ice is in the pools  
before the skaters go 
or any check at nightfall 
is tarnished by the snow before the fields have finished 
before the 
christmas tree 
wonder upon wonder 
will arrive to me
what we touch the hems of 
on a summer's day  
what is only walking 
just a bridge away that which sings so  speaks so when there's no one here  
will the frock i wept in 
answer me to wear
