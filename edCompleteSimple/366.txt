although i put away his life  
an 
ornament too grand 
for 
forehead low as mine to wear 
this might have been the hand
that sowed the flower he preferred  
or smoothed a homely pain 
or pushed the pebble from his path  
or played his chosen tune on 
lute the least  the latest  
but just his 
ear could know 
that whatsoe'er delighted it i never would let go the foot to bear his errand  
a little 
boot i know  
would leap abroad like 
antelope  
with just the grant to do his weariest 
commandment  
a sweeter to obey 
than 
hide and 
seek  
or skip to 
flutes  
or all 
day chase the 
bee your 
servant 
sir will weary  
the 
surgeon will not come  
the 
world will have its own  to do  
the 
dust will vex your 
fame the 
cold will force your tightest door 
some 
february 
day 
but say my apron bring the sticks 
to make your 
cottage gay that i may take that promise 
to 
paradise with me  
to teach the 
angels avarice 
you 
sir taught first  to me
