till 
death  is narrow 
loving  
the scantest 
heart extant 
will hold you till your privilege 
of 
finiteness  be spent but 
he whose loss procures you 
such 
destitution that 
your 
life too abject for itself 
thenceforward imitate until  
resemblance perfect  
yourself for 
his pursuit 
delight of 
nature  abdicate  
exhibit 
love  somewhat
