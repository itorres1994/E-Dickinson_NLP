the 
world  stands  solemner  to me  
since i was wed  to 
him  
a modesty befits the soul 
that bears another's  name  
a doubt  if it be fair  indeed  
to wear that perfect  pearl  
the 
man  upon the 
woman  binds  
to clasp her soul  for all  
a prayer that it more angel  prove  
a whiter 
gift  within  
to that munificence that chose  
so unadorned  a 
queen  
a 
gratitude  that such be true  
it had esteemed the 
dream  
too beautiful  for 
shape to prove  
or posture  to redeem
