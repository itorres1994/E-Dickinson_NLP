701

a 
thought went up my mind today  
that i have had before  
but did not finish  some way back  i could not fix the 
year nor where it went  nor why it came 
the second time to me  
nor definitely what it was  
have i the 
art to say  
but somewhere  in my 
soul  i know  
i've met the 
thing before  
it just reminded me  'twas all  
and came my way no more
