removed from 
accident of 
loss 
by 
accident of 
gain 
befalling not my simple 
days  
myself had just to earn  
of 
riches  as unconscious 
as is the 
brown 
malay 
of 
pearls in 
eastern 
waters 
marked 
his  
what 
holiday 
would stir his slow conception  
had he the power to dream 
that put the 
dower's fraction  
awaited even  
him
