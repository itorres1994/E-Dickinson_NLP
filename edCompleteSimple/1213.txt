we like 
march 
his 
shoes are 
purple  
he is new and high  
makes he 
mud for 
dog and 
peddler 
makes he 
forests dry 
knows the 
adder 
tongue his coming 
and presents her 
spot  
stands the 
sun so close and mighty 
that our 
minds are hot 
news is he of all the others  
bold it were to die 
with the 
blue 
birds exercising 
on his 
british 
sky
