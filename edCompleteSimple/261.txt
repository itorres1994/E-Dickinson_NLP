put up my lute  
what of  my 
music  
since the sole ear i cared to charm  
passive  as 
granite  laps 
my 
music  
sobbing  will suit  as well as psalm 
would but the  
memnon  of the 
desert  
teach me the strain 
that vanquished 
him  
when 
he  surrendered to the 
sunrise  
maybe  that  would awaken  them
