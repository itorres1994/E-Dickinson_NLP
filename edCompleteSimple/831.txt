dying 
to be afraid of thee 
one must to thine 
artillery 
have left exposed a 
friend  
than thine old 
arrow is a 
shot 
delivered straighter to the 
heart 
the leaving 
love behind
not for itself the 
dust is shy 
but enemy 
beloved be 
thy 
batteries divorce 
fight sternly in a 
dying eye 
two 
armies 
love and 
certainty 
and 
love and the reverse
