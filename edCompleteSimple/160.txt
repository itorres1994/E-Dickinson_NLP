160

just lost  when i was saved  
just felt the world go by  
just girt me for the onset with 
eternity  
when breath blew back  
and on the other side i heard recede the disappointed tide 
therefore  as 
one returned  i feel 
odd secrets of the line to tell  
some 
sailor  skirting foreign shores  
some pale 
reporter  from the awful doors 
before the seal 
next time  to stay  
next time  the things to see 
by 
ear unheard  
unscrutinized by 
eye  
next time  to tarry  
while the 
ages steal slow tramp the 
centuries  
and the 
cycles wheel
