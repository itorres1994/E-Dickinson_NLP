dust is the only 
secret  
death  the only 
one 
you cannot find out all about 
in his  native town  
nobody know  his 
father   
never was a 
boy  
hadn't any playmates  
or  
early history  industrious  
laconic  
punctual  
sedate  
bold as a 
brigand  
stiller than a fleet 
builds  like a 
bird  too  
christ robs the 
nest  
robin after 
robin 
smuggled to rest
