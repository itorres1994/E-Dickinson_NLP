better  than 
music 
for i  who heard it  i was used  to the 
birds  before this  was different  '
twas 
translation  
of all tunes i knew  and more '
twasn't contained  like other stanza  
no one could play it  the second time  
but the 
composer  perfect 
mozart  
perish with him  that 
keyless rhyme
so  
children  told how 
brooks in 
eden  
bubbled a better  
melody  
quaintly infer  
eve's great surrender  
urging the feet  that would  not  fly  
children  matured  are wiser  mostly  
eden  a legend  dimly told  
eve  and the 
anguish  
grandame's story  
but  i was telling a tune  i heard not such a strain  the 
church  baptizes  
when the last 
saint  goes up the 
aisles  
not such a stanza splits the silence  
when the 
redemption strikes her 
bells let me not spill  its smallest cadence  
humming  for promise  when alone  
humming  until my faint 
rehearsal  
drop into tune  around the 
throne
