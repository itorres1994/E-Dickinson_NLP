'twas awkward but it fitted me  
an 
ancient fashioned 
heart  
its only lore  its 
steadfastness  
in 
change  unerudite it only moved as do the 
suns  
for merit of 
return  
or 
birds  confirmed perpetual 
by 
alternating 
zone i only have it not 
tonight 
in its established place for technicality of 
death  
omitted in the 
lease
