248

why  do they shut 
me out of 
heaven 
did i sing  too loud 
but  i can say a little 
minor 
timid as a bird
wouldn't the 
angels try me  
just  once  more  
just  see  if i troubled them  
but don't  shut the door
oh if i  were the 
gentleman 
in the 
white 
robe  
and they  were the little 
hand  that knocked could  i  forbid
