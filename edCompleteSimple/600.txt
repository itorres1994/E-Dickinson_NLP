it troubled me as once i was  
for i was once a 
child  
concluding how an 
atom  fell  
and yet the 
heavens  held the 
heavens weighed the most  by far  
yet 
blue  and solid  stood  
without a 
bolt  that i could prove  
would 
giants  understand
life set me larger  problems  
some i shall keep  to solve 
till 
algebra is easier  
or simpler proved  above then  too  be comprehended  
what sorer  puzzled me  
why 
heaven did not break away  
and tumble  
blue  on me
