635

i think the longest hour of all
is when the cars have come —
and we are waiting for the coach —
it seems as though the time

indignant — that the joy was come —
did block the gilded hands —
and would not let the seconds by —
but slowest instant — ends —

the pendulum begins to count —
like little scholars — loud —
the steps grow thicker — in the hall —
the heart begins to crowd —

then i — my timid service done —
tho' service 'twas of love —
take up my little violin —
and further north — remove
