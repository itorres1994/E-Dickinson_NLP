her   last 
poems   
poets  ended  
silver  perished  with her 
tongue  
not on 
record  bubbled other  
flute  or 
woman  
so divine  
not unto its 
summer  
morning 
robin  uttered 
half the 
tune  
gushed too free for the 
adoring  
from the 
angloflorentine  
late  the 
praise  '
tis dull  conferring 
on the 
head too 
high to 
crown  
diadem  or 
ducal 
showing  
be its 
grave  sufficient sign  
nought  that 
we  
no 
poet's 
kinsman  
suffocate  with easy woe  
what  and if  
ourself a 
bridegroom  
put 
her down  in italy
