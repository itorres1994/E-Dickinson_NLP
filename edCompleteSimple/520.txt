i started 
early  
took my 
dog  
and visited the 
sea  
the 
mermaids in the 
basement 
came out to look at me and 
frigates  in the 
upper 
floor 
extended 
hempen 
hands  
presuming 
me to be a 
mouse  
aground  upon the 
sands but no 
man moved 
me  till the 
tide 
went past my simple 
shoe  
and past my 
apron  and my 
belt  
and past my 
bodice  too and made as 
he would eat me up  
as wholly as a 
dew 
upon a 
dandelion's 
sleeve  
and then  i started  too and 
he  
he followed  close behind  i felt his 
silver 
heel 
upon my 
ankle  
then my 
shoes 
would overflow with 
pearl until 
we met the 
solid 
town  
no 
one 
he seemed to know  
and bowing  with a 
mighty look  
at me  
the 
sea withdrew
