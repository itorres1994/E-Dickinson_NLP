two butterflies went out at 
noon  
and waltzed upon a 
farm  
then stepped straight through the 
firmament 
and rested on a 
beam and then  together bore away 
upon a shining 
sea  
though never yet in any 
port  
their coming mentioned  be if spoken by the distant 
bird  
if met in 
ether 
sea 
by 
frigate or by 
merchantman  
no notice  was  to me
