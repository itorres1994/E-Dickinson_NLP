303

the 
soul selects her own 
society  
then  shuts the 
door  
to her divine 
majority  
present no more unmoved  she notes the 
chariots  pausing  
at her low 
gate  
unmoved  an 
emperor be kneeling 
upon her 
mat i've known her  from an ample nation  
choose 
one  
then  close the 
valves of her attention  
like 
stone
