i know a place where 
summer strives 
with such a practised 
frost  
she  each year  leads her 
daisies back  
recording briefly  
lost but when the 
south 
wind stirs the 
pools 
and struggles in the lanes  
her 
heart misgives 
her for 
her 
vow  
and she pours soft refrains
into the lap of 
adamant  
and spices  and the 
dew  
that stiffens quietly to 
quartz  
upon her 
amber 
shoe
