91

so bashful when i spied her 
so pretty  so ashamed 
so hidden in her leaflets 
lest anybody find so breathless till i passed here  
so helpless when i turned 
and bore her struggling blushing 
her simple haunts beyond
for whom i robbed the 
dingle  
for whom i betrayed the 
dell  
many will doubtless ask me 
but i shall never tell
