895

a 
cloud withdrew from the 
sky 
superior 
glory be 
but that 
cloud and its 
auxiliaries 
are forever lost to me
had i but further scanned 
had i secured the 
glow 
in an 
hermetic 
memory 
it had availed me now
never to pass the 
angel 
with a glance and a 
bow 
till i am firm in 
heaven 
is my intention now
