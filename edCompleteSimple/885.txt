our little 
kinsmen  after 
rain 
in plenty may be seen 
a 
pink and 
pulpy multitude 
the tepid 
ground upon
a needless life it seemed to me 
until a little 
bird 
as to a 
hospitality 
advanced and breakfasted
as i of 
he so 
god of 
me i pondered may have judged 
and left the little 
angle 
worm 
with 
modesties enlarged
