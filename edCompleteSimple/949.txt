under the 
light  yet under  
under the 
grass and the 
dirt  
under the 
beetle's 
cellar 
under the 
clover's root 
further than 
arm could stretch 
were it 
giant long  
further than 
sunshine could 
were the 
day 
year long 
over the 
light  yet over  
over the 
arc of the 
bird  
over the 
comet's chimney  
over the 
cubit's head 
further than 
guess can gallop 
further than 
riddle ride  
oh for a 
disc to the 
distance 
between 
ourselves and the dead
