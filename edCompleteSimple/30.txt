adrift 
a little boat adrift 
and night is coming down 
will no one guide a little boat 
unto the nearest town
so 
sailors say  on yesterday  
just as the dusk was brown 
one little boat gave up its strife 
and gurgled down and down
so angels say  on yesterday  
just as the dawn was red 
one little boat  o'erspent with gales  
retrimmed its masts  redecked its sails  
and shot  exultant on
