one 
life of so much 
consequence 
yet i  for it  would pay  
my 
soul's entire income  
in ceaseless  salary one 
pearl  to me  so signal  
that i would instant dive  
although  i knew  to take it  
would cost me  just a life
the 
sea is full  i know it 
that  does not blur my 
gem 
it burns  distinct from all the row  
intact  in diadem
the life is thick  i know it 
yet  not so dense a crowd  
but 
monarchs  are perceptible  
far down the dustiest 
road
