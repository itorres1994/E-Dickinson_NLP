you'll know it  as you know 'tis 
noon  
by 
glory  
as you do the 
sun  
by 
glory  
as you will in 
heaven  
know 
god the 
father  and the son
by intuition 
mightiest 
things 
assert themselves  and not by terms  
i'm 
midnight  need the 
midnight say  
i'm 
sunrise  
need the majesty
omnipotence  had not a 
tongue  
his lisp  is 
lightning  and the 
sun  
his 
conversation  with the 
sea  
how shall you know 
consult your eye
