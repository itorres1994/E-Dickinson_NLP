nature is what we see  
the 
hill  the 
afternoon  
squirrel  
eclipse  the 
bumble bee  
nay  
nature is 
heaven  
nature is what we hear  
the 
bobolink  the 
sea  
thunder  the 
cricket  
nay  
nature is 
harmony  
nature is what we know  
yet have no art to say  
so impotent 
our 
wisdom is 
to her simplicity
