the first 
day that i was a 
life i recollect it  
how still that last 
day that i was a 
life i recollect it  as well '
twas stiller  though the first 
was still   
twas empty  but the first 
was full this  was my finallest 
occasion but then 
my tenderer 
experiment 
toward 
men  
which choose

that  i cannot say   
which choose 
they   
question memory
