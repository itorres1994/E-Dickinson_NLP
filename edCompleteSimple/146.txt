on such a night or such a night 
would anybody care 
if such a little figure 
slipped quiet from its chair so quiet  
oh how quiet 
that nobody might know 
but that the little figure 
rocked softer  to and fro on such a dawn or such a dawn  
would anybody sigh 
that such a little figure 
too sound asleep did lie
for 
chanticleer to wake it  
or stirring house below  
or giddy bird in orchard  
or early task to do
there was a little figure plump 
for every little knoll  
busy needles and spools of thread and trudging feet from school playmates and holidays and nuts and visions vast and small  
strange that the feet so precious charged 
should reach so small a goal
