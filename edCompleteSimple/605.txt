605

the 
spider holds a 
silver 
ball 
in unperceived 
hands  
and dancing softly to 
himself 
his 
yarn of 
pearl  unwinds he plies from 
nought to 
nought  
in unsubstantial 
trade  
supplants our 
tapestries with 
his in half the period an 
hour to rear supreme 
his 
continents of 
light  
then dangle from the 
housewife's 
broom  
his 
boundaries  forgot
