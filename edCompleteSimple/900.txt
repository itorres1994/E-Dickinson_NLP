what did 
they do since i saw 
them  
were 
they industrious  
so many questions to put 
them 
have i the eagerness
that could i snatch 
their 
faces 
that could 
their lips reply 
not till the last was answered 
should 
they start for the sky 
not if 
their 
party were waiting  
not if to talk with 
me 
were to 
them now  
homesickness 
after eternity 
not if the 
just suspect me 
and offer a 
reward 
would i restore my 
booty 
to that 
bold 
person  
god
