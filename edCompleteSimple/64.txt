some 
rainbow  coming from the 
fair 
some 
vision of the 
world 
cashmere  i confidently see 
or else a 
peacock's purple 
train 
feather by feather  on the plain 
fritters itself away
the dreamy 
butterflies bestir 
lethargic pools resume the whir 
of last year's sundered tune 
from some old 
fortress on the sun 
baronial 
bees  march  one by one  
in murmuring platoon
the 
robins stand as thick today 
as flakes of snow stood yesterday  
on fence  and 
roof  and 
twig 
the 
orchis binds her feather on 
for her old lover  
don the 
sun 
revisiting the bog
without 
commander 
countless 
still 
the 
regiments of 
wood and 
hill 
in bright detachment stand 
behold 
whose 
multitudes are these 
the children of whose turbaned seas  
or what 
circassian 
land
