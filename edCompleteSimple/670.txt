one need not be a 
chamber  to be 
haunted  
one need not be a 
house  
the 
brain has 
corridors  surpassing 
material 
place far safer  of a 
midnight 
meeting 
external 
ghost 
than its interior 
confronting  
that 
cooler host 
far safer  through an 
abbey gallop  
the 
stones a'chase  
than 
unarmed  one's a'self encounter  
in lonesome 
place ourself behind ourself  concealed should startle most  
assassin hid in our 
apartment 
be 
horror's least 
the 
body  borrows a 
revolver  
he bolts the 
door  
o'erlooking a superior spectre  
or 
more
