it ceased to hurt me though so slow i could not feel the 
anguish go  
but only knew by looking back  
that something  had benumbed the 
track nor when it altered i could say 
for i had worn it every day 
as constant as the 
childish frock  i hung upon the 
peg at night
but not the 
grief  that nestled close 
as needles  ladies softly press 
to 
cushions 
cheeks  
to keep their place nor what consoled it i could trace except whereas 'twas 
wilderness it's better  almost 
peace
