this 
consciousness that is aware 
of 
neighbors and the 
sun 
will be the one aware of 
death 
and that itself alone
is traversing the interval 
experience between 
and most profound experiment 
appointed unto 
men how adequate unto itself 
its properties shall be 
itself unto itself and none 
shall make discovery 
adventure most unto itself 
the 
soul condemned to be  
attended by a single 
hound 
its own identity
