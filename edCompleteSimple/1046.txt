1046

i've dropped my 
brain  
my 
soul is numb  
the 
veins that used to run 
stop palsied  'tis 
paralysis 
done perfecter on stone
vitality is 
carved and cool 
my nerve in 
marble lies  
a 
breathing 
woman 
yesterday  
endowed with paradise
not dumb  i had a sort that moved  
a 
sense that smote and stirred  
instincts for 
dance  a caper part  
an 
aptitude for 
bird who wrought 
carrara in me 
and chiselled all my tune 
were it a 
witchcraft  were it 
death  
i've still a chance to strain
to 
being somewhere  
motion  
breath  
though 
centuries beyond 
and every limit a 
decade  
i'll shiver satisfied
