660

'tis good  the looking back on 
grief  
to reendure a 
day  
we thought the 
mighty 
funeral  
of 
all 
conceived 
joy to recollect how 
busy 
grass 
did meddle  one by one  
till all the 
grief with 
summer  waved 
and none could see the stone 
and though the 
woe you have 
today 
be larger  
as the 
sea 
exceeds its 
unremembered 
drop  
they're 
water  equally
