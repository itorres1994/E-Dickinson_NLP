10

my wheel is in the dark  i cannot see a spoke 
yet know its dripping feet 
go round and round 
my foot is on the 
tide  
an unfrequented road  
yet have all roads 
a clearing at the end some have resigned the 
loom  
some in the busy tomb 
find quaint employ some with new  stately feet  
pass royal through the gate  
flinging the problem back 
at you and i
