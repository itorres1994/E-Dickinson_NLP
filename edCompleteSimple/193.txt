193

i shall know why  when 
time is over  
and i have ceased to wonder why  
christ will explain each separate anguish 
in the fair schoolroom of the sky he will tell me what 
peter promised  
and i  for wonder at his woe  i shall forget the drop of 
anguish 
that scalds me now  that scalds me now
