if 
i'm lost  now 
that i was found  
shall still my transport be  
that once  on me  those 
jasper 
gates 
blazed open  suddenly that in my awkward  gazing  face  
the 
angels  softly peered  
and touched me with their fleeces 
almost as if they cared  
i'm banished  now  you know it how foreign that can be  
you'll know  
sir  when the 
savior's face 
turns so  away from you
