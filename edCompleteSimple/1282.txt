art thou the thing i wanted 
begone  my 
tooth has grown  
supply the minor 
palate 
that has not starved so long  i tell thee while i waited 
the mystery of 
food 
increased till i abjured it 
and dine without 
like 
god art thou the thing i wanted 
begone  my 
tooth has grown  
affront a minor palate 
thou could'st not goad so long i tell thee while i waited  
the mystery of 
food 
increased till i abjured it 
subsisting now like 
god
