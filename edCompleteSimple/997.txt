crumbling is not an instant's 
act 
a fundamental pause 
dilapidation's processes 
are organized 
decays '
tis first a 
cobweb on the 
soul 
a 
cuticle of 
dust 
a 
borer in the 
axis 
an 
elemental 
rust ruin is formal  
devil's work 
consecutive and slow  
fail in an instant no man did 
slipping  is 
crash's law
