1724

how dare the robins sing 
when men and women hear 
who since they went to their account 
have settled with the year  
paid all that life had earned 
in one consummate bill 
and now what life or death can do 
is immaterial 
insulting is the sun 
to him whose mortal light 
beguiled of immortality 
bequeaths him to the night 
extinct be every hum 
in deference to him 
whose garden wrestles with the dew 
at daybreak overcome
