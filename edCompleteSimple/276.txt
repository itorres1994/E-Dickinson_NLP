many a phrase has the 
english language  i have heard but one  
low as the laughter of the 
cricket 
loud as the 
thunder's 
tongue murmuring like old 
caspian 
choirs 
when the 
tide's a' lull  
saying itself in new infection  
like a 
whippoorwill breaking in bright 
orthography 
on my simple sleep  
thundering its 
prospective  
till i stir and weep not for the 
sorrow done me  
but the push of 
joy  
say it again 
saxton 
hush  
only to me
