i taste a liquor never brewed  
from 
tankards scooped in 
pearl  
not all the 
vats upon the 
rhine 
yield such an alcohol
inebriate of 
air  am i  
and 
debauchee of 
dew  
reeling  thro endless summer days  
from inns of 
molten 
blue when 
landlords turn the drunken 
bee 
out of the 
foxglove's door  
when 
butterflies  renounce their drams  i shall but drink the more
till 
seraphs swing their snowy 
hats  
and 
saints  to windows run  
to see the little 
tippler 
leaning against the  
sun
