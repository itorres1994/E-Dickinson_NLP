i cannot buy it  'tis not sold  
there is no other in the 
world  
mine was the only one
i was so happy i forgot 
to shut the 
door 
and it went out 
and i am all alone if i could find it 
anywhere i would not mind the journey there 
though it took all my store
but just to look it in the 
eye  
did'st thou 
thou did'st not mean to say 
then turn my 
face away
