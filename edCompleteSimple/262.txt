the lonesome for they know not 
what  
the 
eastern 
exiles  be  
who strayed beyond the 
amber line 
some madder 
holiday and ever since  the purple 
moat 
they strive to climb  in vain  
as 
birds  that tumble from the clouds 
do fumble at the strain the 
blessed 
ether  taught them  
some 
transatlantic 
morn  
when 
heaven  was too common  to miss  
too sure  to dote upon
