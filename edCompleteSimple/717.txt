the 
beggar 
lad  dies early  
it's 
somewhat in the 
cold  
and 
somewhat in the 
trudging feet and haply  in the 
world the 
cruel  smiling  bowing 
world  
that took its 
cambric 
way  
nor heard the timid cry for  
bread    
sweet 
lady  
charity  among 
redeemed 
children 
if 
trudging feet may stand 
the 
barefoot time forgotten  so  
the 
sleet  the bitter 
wind the 
childish 
hands that teased for 
pence 
lifted adoring  them  
to 
him whom never 
ragged  
coat 
did supplicate in vain
