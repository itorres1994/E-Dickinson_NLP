the 
bone that has no 
marrow 
what 
ultimate for that 
it is not fit for 
table 
for 
beggar or for cat
a 
bone has obligations  
a 
being has the same  
a 
marrowless 
assembly 
is culpabler than shame
but how shall finished 
creatures 
a function fresh obtain 
old 
nicodemus' 
phantom 
confronting us again
