escape is such a thankful 
word i often in the 
night 
consider it unto myself 
no spectacle in sight
escape  it is the 
basket 
in which the 
heart is caught 
when down some awful 
battlement 
the rest of 
life is dropt '
tis not to sight the savior  
it is to be the saved  
and that is why i lay my 
head 
upon this trusty word
