flowers  
well  if anybody 
can the ecstasy define  
half a transport  half a trouble  
with which flowers humble men  
anybody find the fountain 
from which floods so contra flow  i will give him all the 
daisies 
which upon the hillside blow 
too much pathos in their faces 
for a simple breast like mine  
butterflies from 
st  
domingo 
cruising round the purple line  
have a system of aesthetics  
far superior to mine
