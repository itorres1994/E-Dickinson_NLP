unto my 
books  so good to turn  
far ends of tired 
days  
it half endears the 
abstinence  
and 
pain  is missed  in 
praise as 
flavors  cheer 
retarded 
guests 
with 
banquettings to be  
so 
spices  stimulate the time 
till my small 
library it may be 
wilderness  without  
far feet of failing 
men  
but 
holiday  excludes the night  
and it is 
bells  within i thank these 
kinsmen of the 
shelf  
their 
countenances 
kid 
enamor  in 
prospective  
and satisfy  obtained
