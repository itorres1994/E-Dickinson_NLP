these are the 
nights that 
beetles love  
from 
eminence remote 
drives ponderous perpendicular 
his figure intimate 
the terror of the 
children 
the merriment of men 
depositing his 
thunder 
he hoists abroad again  
a 
bomb upon the 
ceiling 
is an improving thing  
it keeps the nerves progressive 
conjecture flourishing  
too dear the 
summer evening 
without discreet alarm  
supplied by 
entomology 
with its remaining charm
