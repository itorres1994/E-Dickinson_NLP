i see thee better  in the 
dark  i do not need a 
light  
the 
love of 
thee  a 
prism be  
excelling 
violet i see thee better for the 
years 
that hunch themselves between  
the 
miner's 
lamp  sufficient be  
to nullify the 
mine and in the 
grave  i see 
thee best its little 
panels be 
aglow  
all ruddy  with the 
light i held so high for 
thee what need of 
day  
to 
those whose 
dark  hath so  surpassing 
sun  
it deem it be  
continually  
at the meridian
