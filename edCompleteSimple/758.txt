these  saw 
visions latch them softly  
these  held 
dimples  
smooth them slow  
this  addressed departing accents  
quick  
sweet 
mouth  to miss thee so this  
we stroked  
unnumbered 
satin  
these  we held among our own  
fingers of the 
slim 
aurora  
not so arrogant  this 
noon these  adjust  that ran to meet us  
pearl  for 
stocking  
pearl for 
shoe  
paradise  the only 
palace 
fit for 
her reception  now
