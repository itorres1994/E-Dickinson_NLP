who never lost  are unprepared 
a 
coronet to find  
who never thirsted 
flagons  and 
cooling tamarind 
who never climbed the weary league  
can such a foot explore 
the purple territories 
on 
pizarro's shore 
how many 
legions overcome  
the 
emperor will say  
how many 
colors taken 
on 
revolution day 
how many 
bullets bearest  
hast 
thou the 
royal scar  
angels  
write  
promoted  
on this 
soldier's brow
