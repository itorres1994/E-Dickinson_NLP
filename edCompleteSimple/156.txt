you love me  you are sure  i shall not fear mistake  i shall not cheated wake  
some grinning morn  
to find the 
sunrise left  
and 
orchards  unbereft  
and 
dollie  gone
i need not start  you're sure  
that night will never be  
when frightened  home to 
thee i run  
to find the windows dark  
and no more 
dollie  mark  
quite none
be sure you're sure  you know  
i'll bear it better now  
if you'll just tell me so  
than when  a little dull 
balm grown  
over this pain of mine  
you sting  again
