the 
gentian weaves her fringes  
the 
maple's loom is red  
my departing blossoms 
obviate parade 
a brief but patient illness  
an hour to prepare 
and one below this morning 
is where the angels are it was a short procession 
the 
bobolink was there  
an aged 
bee addressed us  
and then we knelt in prayer  
we trust that she was willing  
we ask that we may be 
summer  
sister  
seraph 
let us go with thee
in the name of the 
bee  
and of the 
butterfly  
and of the 
breeze  amen
