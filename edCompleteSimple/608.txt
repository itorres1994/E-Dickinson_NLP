afraid  
of whom am i afraid  
not 
death  for who is 
he  
the 
porter of my 
father's 
lodge 
as much abasheth me 
of 
life  '
twere odd i fear a thing 
that comprehendeth me 
in one or two existences  
as 
deity decree of 
resurrection  
is the 
east 
afraid to trust the 
morn 
with her fastidious forehead  
as soon impeach my crown
