musicians wrestle everywhere  
all day  among the crowded air i hear the silver strife  
and  walking  long before the morn  
such transport breaks upon the town i think it that  
new life  
if is not 
bird  it has no nest  
nor  
band   in brass and scarlet  drest  
nor 
tamborin  nor 
man  
it is not 
hymn from pulpit read  
the  
morning 
stars  the 
treble led 
on 
time's first afternoon 
some  say  it is  the 
spheres   at play  
some say that bright 
majority 
of vanished 
dames  and 
men  
some  think it service in the place 
where we  with late  celestial face  
please 
god  shall ascertain
