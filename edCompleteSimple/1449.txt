1449

i thought the 
train would never come  
how slow the whistle sang  i don't believe a peevish 
bird 
so whimpered for the 
spring  i taught my 
heart a hundred times 
precisely what to say  
provoking 
lover when you came 
its 
treatise flew away 
to hide my strategy too late 
to wiser be too soon  
for miseries so halcyon 
the happiness atone
