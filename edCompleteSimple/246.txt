forever at 
his side to walk  
the smaller of the two  
brain of 
his 
brain  
blood of 
his 
blood  
two lives  
one 
being  now forever of 
his fate to taste  
if grief  the largest part  
if joy  to put my piece away 
for that beloved 
heart all life  to know each other  
whom we can never learn  
and bye and bye  a 
change  
called 
heaven  
rapt 
neighborhoods of 
men  
just finding out  what puzzled us  
without the lexicon
