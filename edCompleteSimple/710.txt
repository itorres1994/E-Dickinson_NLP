the 
sunrise runs for 
both  
the 
east  
her 
purple 
troth 
keeps with the 
hill  
the 
noon unwinds 
her 
blue 
till 
one 
breadth cover 
two  
remotest  still nor does the 
night forget 
a 
lamp for 
each  to set  
wicks wide away  
the 
north  
her blazing 
sign 
erects in 
iodine  
till 
both  can see the 
midnight's 
dusky 
arms 
clasp 
hemispheres and 
homes 
and so 
upon 
her 
bosom  
one  
and 
one upon 
her 
hem  
both lie
