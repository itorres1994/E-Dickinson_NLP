that odd old man is dead a year  
we miss his stated 
hat  '
twas such an evening bright and stiff 
his faded lamp went out 
who miss his antiquated 
wick  
are any hoar for him  
waits any indurated mate 
his wrinkled coming home 
oh 
life  begun in fluent 
blood 
and consummated dull  
achievement contemplating thee  
feels transitive and cool
