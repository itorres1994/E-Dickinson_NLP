who were  the 
father and the 
son  
we pondered when a child  
and what had they to do with us 
and when portentous told
with inference appalling 
by 
childhood fortified 
we thought  at least they are no worse 
than they have been described 
who are  the 
father and the 
son  
did we demand 
today  
the 
father and the 
son  himself 
would doubtless specify but had they the felicity 
when we desired to know  
we better 
friends had been  perhaps  
than time ensue to be we start  to learn that we believe 
but once  entirely  
belief  it does not fit so well 
when altered frequently we blush  that 
heaven if we achieve  
event ineffable  
we shall have shunned until ashamed 
to own the 
miracle
