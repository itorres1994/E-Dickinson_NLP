a 
wounded 
deer  leaps highest i've heard the 
hunter tell  '
tis but the 
ecstasy of death  
and then the 
brake is still
the 
smitten 
rock that gushes 
the trampled 
steel that springs 
a 
cheek is always redder 
just where the 
hectic stings
mirth is the 
mail of 
anguish 
in which it 
cautious 
arm 
lest anybody spy the blood 
and you're hurt exclaim
