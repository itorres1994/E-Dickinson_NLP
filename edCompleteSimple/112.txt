where bells no more affright the morn  
where scrabble never comes  
where very nimble 
gentlemen 
are forced to keep their rooms where tired 
children placid sleep 
thro' 
centuries of noon 
this place is 
bliss  this town is 
heaven  
please 
pater pretty soon
oh could we climb where 
moses stood 
and view the 
landscape o'er 
not 
father's bells  nor 
factories 
could scare us any more
