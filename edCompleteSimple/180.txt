as if some little 
arctic flower 
upon the polar hem  
went wandering down the 
latitudes 
until it puzzled came 
to continents of summer  
to firmaments of sun  
to strange  bright crowds of flowers  
and birds  of foreign tongue  i say  
as if this little flower 
to 
eden  wandered in  
what then  
why nothing  
only  your inference therefrom
