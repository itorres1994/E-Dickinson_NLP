out of sight 
what of that 
see the 
bird  reach it 
curve by 
curve  
sweep by 
sweep  
round the 
steep 
air  
danger 
what is that to 
her 
better 'tis to fail  there  
than debate  here blue is 
blue  the 
world through  
amber  
amber  
dew  
dew  
seek  
friend  and see  
heaven is shy of 
earth  that's all bashful 
heaven  thy 
lovers small  
hide  too  from thee
