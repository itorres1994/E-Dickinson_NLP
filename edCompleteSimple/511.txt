if you were coming in the 
fall 
i'd brush the 
summer by 
with half a smile and half a spurn 
as 
housewives do a fly
if i could see you in a year 
i'd wind the months in balls  
and put them each in separate 
drawers 
for fear the numbers fuse  
if only 
centuries delayed 
i'd count them on my 
hand 
subtracting till my fingers dropped 
into 
van 
dieman's land
if certain when this life was out  
that yours and mine should be 
i'd toss it yonder like a 
rind 
and take 
eternity but now uncertain of the length 
of this that is between 
it goads me like the 
goblin 
bee  
that will not state  its sting
