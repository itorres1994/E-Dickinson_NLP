1227

my 
triumph lasted till the 
drums 
had left the 
dead alone 
and then i dropped my 
victory 
and chastened stole along 
to where the finished 
faces 
conclusion turned on me 
and then i hated 
glory 
and wished myself were they
what is to be is best descried 
when it has also been  
could 
prospect taste of 
retrospect 
the tyrannies of 
men 
were 
tenderer  diviner 
the 
transitive toward 
a 
bayonet's contrition 
is nothing to the dead
