bring me the sunset in a cup  
reckon the morning's flagons up 
and say how many 
dew  
tell me how far the morning leaps tell me what time the weaver sleeps 
who spun the breadth of blue 
write me how many notes there be 
in the new 
robin's ecstasy 
among astonished boughs  
how many trips the 
tortoise makes  
how many cups the 
bee partakes  
the 
debauchee of dews 
also  who laid the 
rainbow's piers  
also  who leads the docile spheres 
by withes of supple blue  
whose fingers string the stalactite who counts the wampum of the night 
to see that none is due 
who built this little 
alban 
house 
and shut the windows down so close 
my spirit cannot see  
who'll let me out some gala day 
with implements to fly away  
passing pomposity
