why make it doubt  it hurts it so  
so sick  to guess  
so strong  to know  
so brave  upon its little 
bed 
to tell the very last 
they said 
unto 
itself  and smile  
and shake  
for that dear  distant  dangerous  
sake  
but  the 
instead  the 
pinching fear 
that 
something  it did do  or dare  
offend the 
vision  and it flee  
and 
they no more remember me  
nor ever turn to tell me why  
oh 
master 
this is 
misery
