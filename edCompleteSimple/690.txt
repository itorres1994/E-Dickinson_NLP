victory comes late  
and is held low to freezing lips  
too rapt with frost 
to take it  
how sweet it would have tasted  
just a 
drop  
was 
god so economical 
his 
table's spread too high for 
us  
unless 
we dine on tiptoe  
crumbs  fit such little mouths  
cherries  suit 
robbins  
the 
eagle's 
golden 
breakfast strangles  
them  
god keep 
his 
oath to 
sparrows  
who of little 
love  know how to starve
