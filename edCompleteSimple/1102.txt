1102

his 
bill is clasped  his 
eye forsook  
his 
feathers wilted low  
the 
claws that clung like lifeless 
gloves 
indifferent hanging now  
the 
joy that in his happy 
throat 
was waiting to be poured 
gored through and through with 
death to be 
assassin of a 
bird 
resembles to my outraged mind 
the firing in 
heaven 
on 
angels  squandering for you 
their 
miracles of 
tune
