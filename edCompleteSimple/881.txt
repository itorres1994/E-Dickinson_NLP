i've none to tell me to but 
thee 
so when 
thou failest nobody 
it was a little tie  
it just held 
two nor those it held 
since 
somewhere thy sweet 
face has spilled 
beyond my 
boundary if things were opposite  and 
me 
and 
me it were  that ebbed from 
thee 
on some unanswering 
shore  
would'st 
thou seek so  just say 
that i the 
answer may pursue 
unto the lips it eddied through  
so  overtaking 
thee
