for this  accepted 
breath  
through it  compete with 
death  
the fellow cannot touch this 
crown  
by it  my title take  
ah what a royal sake 
to my necessity  stooped down
no 
wilderness  can be 
where this attendeth me  
no 
desert 
noon  
no fear of frost to come 
haunt the perennial bloom  
but 
certain june
get 
gabriel  to tell  the royal syllable  
get 
saints  with new  unsteady tongue  
to say what trance below 
most like their glory show  
fittest the crown
