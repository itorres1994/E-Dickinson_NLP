there's been a 
death in the 
opposite 
house 
as lately as 
today  i know it by the numb look 
such 
houses have  alway the 
neighbors rustle in and out  
the 
doctor  drives away  
a 
window opens like a 
pod  
abrupt  mechanically somebody flings a 
mattress out  
the 
children hurry by  
they wonder if it died  on that  i used to  when a 
boy the 
minister  goes stiffly in  
as if the 
house were 
his  
and 
he owned all the 
mourners  now  
and little 
boys  besides and then the 
milliner  and the 
man 
of the 
appalling 
trade  
to take the measure of the 
house  
there'll be that 
dark 
parade of 
tassels  and of 
coaches  soon  
it's easy as a 
sign  
the 
intuition of the 
news  
in just a 
country 
town
