in falling 
timbers buried  
there breathed a 
man  
outside  the spades  were plying  
the 
lungs  within could 
he  know  they sought 
him  
could 
they  know  
he breathed  
horrid 
sand 
partition  
neither  could be heard never slacked the 
diggers  
but when 
spades had done  
oh  
reward of 
anguish  
it was dying  
then  
many 
things  are fruitless  '
tis a 
baffling 
earth  
but there is no 
gratitude 
like the 
grace  of 
death
