my 
life had stood  a 
loaded 
gun  
in 
corners  till a 
day 
the 
owner passed  identified  
and carried 
me away and now 
we roam in 
sovereign 
woods  
and now 
we hunt the 
doe  
and every time i speak for 
him  
the 
mountains straight reply and do i smile such cordial light 
upon the 
valley glow  
it is as a 
vesuvian face 
had let its pleasure through and when at 
night  
our good 
day done  i guard 
my 
master's 
head  '
tis better than the 
eiderduck's 
deep 
pillow  to have shared to foe of 
his  
i'm deadly foe  
none stir the second time  
on whom i lay a 
yellow 
eye  
or an emphatic 
thumb though i than 
he  may longer live 
he longer must  than i  
for i have but the power to kill 
without  the power to die
