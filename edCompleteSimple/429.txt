the 
moon is distant from the 
sea  
and yet  with 
amber 
hands  
she leads 
him  docile as a 
boy  
along appointed 
sands he never misses a 
degree  
obedient to 
her 
eye 
he comes just so far  toward the 
town  
just so far  goes away oh  
signor  
thine  the 
amber 
hand  
and mine  the distant 
sea  
obedient to the least command 
thine eye impose on me
