one 
year ago  jots what  
god  spell the word  i  can't  
was't 
grace  
not that  
was't 
glory  
that  will do  
spell slower  
glory such 
anniversary shall be  
sometimes  not often  in 
eternity  
when farther 
parted  than the 
common 
woe  
look  feed upon each other's faces  so  
in doubtful meal  if it be possible 
their 
banquet's true i tasted  careless  then  i did not know the 
wine 
came once a 
world  
did you  
oh  had you told me so  
this 
thirst would blister  easier  now  
you said it hurt you  most  
mine  was an 
acorn's 
breast  
and could not know how fondness grew 
in 
shaggier 
vest  
perhaps  i couldn't  
but  had you looked in  
a 
giant  eye to eye with you  had been  
no 
acorn  then so  
twelve months ago  
we breathed  
then dropped the 
air  
which bore it best  
was this  the patientest  
because it was a 
child  you know  
and could not value  air 
if to be  
elder   mean most pain  
i'm old enough  today  
i'm certain  then  
as old as thee  how soon  
one  
birthday more  or 
ten  
let me  choose  
ah  
sir  none
