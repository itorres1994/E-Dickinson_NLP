a little bread  a crust  a crumb  
a little trust  a demijohn  
can keep the soul alive  
not portly  mind  but breathing  warm  
conscious  as old 
napoleon  
the night before the crown 
a modest lot  
a fame petite  
a brief 
campaign of sting and sweet 
is plenty  
is enough  
a 
sailor's business is the shore  
a 
soldier's  balls  
who asketh more  
must seek the neighboring life
