858

this 
chasm  
sweet  upon my life i mention it to you  
when 
sunrise through a fissure drop 
the 
day must follow too 
if we demur  its gaping sides 
disclose as 'twere a 
tomb 
ourself am lying straight wherein 
the 
favorite of doom 
when it has just contained a 
life 
then  
darling  it will close 
and yet so bolder every 
day 
so turbulent it grows
i'm tempted half to stitch it up 
with a remaining 
breath i should not miss in yielding  though 
to 
him  it would be 
death and so i bear it big about 
my 
burial  before 
a 
life quite ready to depart 
can harass me no more
