she bore it till the simple veins 
traced azure on her hand  
til pleading  round her quiet eyes 
the purple 
crayons stand 
till 
daffodils had come and gone i cannot tell the sum  
and then she ceased to bear it  
and with the 
saints sat down 
no more her patient figure 
at twilight soft to meet  
no more her timid bonnet 
upon the village street but 
crowns instead  and 
courtiers  
and in the midst so fair  
whose but her shy  immortal face 
of whom we're whispering here
