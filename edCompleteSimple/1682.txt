1682

summer begins to have the look 
peruser of enchanting 
book 
reluctantly but sure perceives 
a gain upon the backward leaves autumn begins to be inferred 
by millinery of the cloud 
or deeper color in the shawl 
that wraps the everlasting hill
the eye begins its avarice 
a meditation chastens speech 
some 
dyer of a distant tree 
resumes his gaudy industry
conclusion is the course of 
all 
at most to be perennial 
and then elude stability 
recalls to immortality
