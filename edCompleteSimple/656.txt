the name  of it  is  
autumn   
the hue  of it  is 
blood  
an 
artery  upon the 
hill  
a 
vein  along the 
road  
great 
globules  in the 
alleys  
and 
oh  the 
shower of 
stain  
when 
winds  upset the 
basin  
and spill the 
scarlet 
rain it sprinkles 
bonnets  far below  
it gathers ruddy 
pools  
then  eddies like a 
rose  away  
upon 
vermilion 
wheels
