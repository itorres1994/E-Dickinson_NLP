i'm sorry for the 
dead  
today  
it's such congenial times 
old 
neighbors have at fences  
it's time o' year for hay
and 
broad  
sunburned 
acquaintance 
discourse between the 
toil  
and laugh a homely species 
that makes the 
fences smile it seems so straight to lie away 
from all of the noise of 
fields  
the 
busy 
carts  the fragrant 
cocks  
the 
mower's 
metre  
steals a 
trouble lest they're homesick  
those 
farmers  and their 
wives  
set separate from the 
farming  
and all the 
neighbors' lives a 
wonder if the 
sepulchre 
don't feel a lonesome way  
when 
men  and 
boys  and 
carts  and 
june 
go down the 
fields to 
hay
