they called me to the 
window for  '
twas 
sunset  
some one said i only saw a 
sapphire 
farm  
and just a 
single 
herd of 
opal 
cattle  feeding far 
upon so vain a 
hill  
as even while i looked  dissolved nor 
cattle were  nor 
soil  
but in their stead  a 
sea  displayed  
and 
ships  of such a size 
as 
crew of 
mountains  could afford  
and 
decks  to seat the skies this  too  the 
showman rubbed away  
and when i looked again  
nor 
farm  nor 
opal 
herd  was there  
nor 
mediterranean
