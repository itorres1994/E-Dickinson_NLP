volume  
written by faded men 
at the suggestion of 
holy 
spectres  
subjects

eden  the ancient 
homestead  
satan  the 
brigadier  
judas  the 
great 
defaulter  
david  the 
troubador

precipice 
others must resist  
boys that believe are very lonesome  
other 
boys are lost

tale a warbling 
teller all the 
boys would come  
orpheus' 
sermon captivated  
it did not condemn
