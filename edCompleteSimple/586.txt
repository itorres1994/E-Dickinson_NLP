we talked as 
girls do  
fond and late  
we speculated fair on every subject but the 
grave  
of ours none affair we handled 
destinies as cool  
as we  
disposers  be  
and 
god a 
quiet 
party 
to our 
authority but fondest dwelt upon 
ourself 
as we eventual  be  
when 
girls to 
women softly raised 
we  occupy  
degree we parted with a contract 
to cherish and to write 
but 
heaven made both impossible 
before another night
