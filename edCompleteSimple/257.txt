delight is as the flight or in the 
ratio of it 
as the 
schools would say  
the 
rainbow's way  
a 
skein 
flung colored after 
rain 
would suit as bright 
except that flight 
were 
aliment 
if it would last i asked the 
east 
when that 
bent 
stripe 
struck up my childish 
firmament  
and 
i for glee 
took 
rainbows as the common way 
and empty 
skies 
the 
eccentricity and so with 
lives  
and so with 
butterflies  
seen magic  through the fright 
that they will cheat the sight  
and 
dower latitudes far on  
some sudden morn  
our portion  in the fashion  
done
