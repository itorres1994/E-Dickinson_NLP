superfluous were the 
sun 
when 
excellence be dead 
he were superfluous every 
day 
for every 
day be said
that syllable whose 
faith 
just saves it from 
despair 
and whose 
i'll meet 
you hesitates 
if 
love inquire 
where upon 
his dateless 
fame 
our 
periods may lie 
as 
stars that drop anonymous 
from an abundant sky
