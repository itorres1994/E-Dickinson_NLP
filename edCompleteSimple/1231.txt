1231

somewhere upon the general 
earth 
itself exist 
today  
the 
magic passive but extant 
that consecrated me indifferent 
seasons doubtless play 
where i for right to be  
would pay each 
atom that i am 
but 
immortality reserving that but just to prove 
another 
date of 
thee  
oh 
god of 
width  do not for us 
curtail eternity
