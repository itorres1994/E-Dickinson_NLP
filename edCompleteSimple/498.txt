i envy 
seas  whereon 
he rides  i envy 
spokes of 
wheels 
of 
chariots  that 
him convey  i envy 
crooked hills
that gaze upon 
his journey  
how easy 
all can see 
what is forbidden utterly 
as 
heaven  unto me 
i envy 
nests of 
sparrows  
that dot 
his distant 
eaves  
the wealthy 
fly  upon 
his 
pane  
the happy  happy 
leaves that just abroad 
his 
window 
have 
summer's leave to play  
the 
ear 
rings of 
pizarro 
could not obtain for me i envy 
light  that wakes 
him  
and 
bells  that boldly ring 
to tell 
him it is 
noon  abroad  
myself  be 
noon to 
him yet interdict  my 
blossom  
and abrogate  my 
bee  
lest 
noon in 
everlasting 
night  
drop 
gabriel  and 
me
