'tis 
sunrise  
little 
maid  
hast 
thou 
no 
station in the 
day '
twas not thy wont to hinder so  
retrieve thine industry '
tis 
noon  
my little 
maid  
alas  and art thou sleeping yet 
the 
lily  waiting to be 
wed  
the 
bee  
hast thou forgot
my little 
maid  '
tis 
night  
alas 
that 
night should be to thee 
instead of 
morning  
had'st thou broached 
thy little 
plan to 
die  
dissuade thee if i could not 
sweet i might have aided  thee
