savior 
i've no one else to tell  
and so i trouble thee i am the one forgot thee so  
dost thou remember me 
nor for myself i came so far  
that were the little load  i brought thee the imperial 
heart i had not strength to hold  
the 
heart i carried in my own  
till mine too heavy grew  
yet  strangest  heavier since it went  
is it too large for you
