us far apart  
as separate as 
sea 
and 
her unsown 
peninsula  
we signified 
these see they took away our 
eyes  
they thwarted 
us with 
guns  
i see 
thee each responded straight 
through 
telegraphic 
signs with 
dungeons  
they devised  
but through their thickest skill  
and their opaquest

our 
souls saw  just as well they summoned 
us to die  
with sweet alacrity 
we stood upon our stapled feet  
condemned  but just  to see permission to recant  
permission to forget  
we turned our backs upon the 
sun 
for perjury of that not 
either  noticed 
death  
of 
paradise  aware  
each other's 
face  was all the 
disc 
each other's setting  saw
