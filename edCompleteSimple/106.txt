the 
daisy follows soft the 
sun  
and when his golden walk is done sits shyly at his feet  
he  waking  finds the flower there  
wherefore  
marauder  art thou here 
because 
sir love is sweet
we are the 
flower  
thou the 
sun 
forgive us if as days decline  
we nearer steal to 
thee 
enamored of the parting 
west  
the peace  the flight  the 
amethyst  
night's possibility
