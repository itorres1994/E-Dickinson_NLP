morning  means 
milking  to the 
farmer  
dawn  to the 
teneriffe  
dice  to the 
maid  
morning means just 
risk  to the 
lover  
just revelation  to the 
beloved epicures  date a 
breakfast  by it  
brides  an 
apocalypse  
worlds  a 
flood  
faintgoing 
lives  
their 
lapse from 
sighing  
faith  
the 
experiment of 
our lord
