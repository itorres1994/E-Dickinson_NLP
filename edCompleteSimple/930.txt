there is a 
june when 
corn is cut 
and 
roses in the 
seed  
a 
summer briefer than the first 
but tenderer indeed
as should a 
face supposed the 
grave's 
emerge a single 
noon 
in the 
vermilion that it wore 
affect us and return two 
seasons it is said exist  
the 
summer of the 
just 
and this of 
ours diversified 
with 
prospect and with 
frost may not our 
second with its 
first 
so infinite compare 
that 
we but recollect the one 
the other to prefer
