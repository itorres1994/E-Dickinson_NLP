crisis is a 
hair 
toward which the forces creep 
past which forces retrograde 
if it come in sleep
to suspend the 
breath 
is the most we can 
ignorant is it 
life or 
death 
nicely balancing
let an instant push 
or an 
atom press 
or a 
circle hesitate 
in circumference
it  may jolt the 
hand 
that adjusts the 
hair 
that secures 
eternity 
from presenting  
here
