arcturus is his other name  
i'd rather call him 
star 
it's very mean of 
science 
to go and interfere
i slew a worm the other day  
a 
savant passing by 
murmured 
resurgam  
centipede 
oh 
lord  how frail are we
i pull a flower from the woods  
a monster with a glass 
computes the stamens in a breath and has her in a class
whereas i took the 
butterfly 
aforetime in my hat  
he sits erect in 
cabinets  
the 
clover bells forgot
what once was 
heaven 
is 
zenith now  
where i proposed to go 
when 
time's brief masquerade was done 
is mapped and charted too
what if the poles should frisk about 
and stand upon their heads i hope 
i'm ready for the worst  
whatever prank betides
perhaps the 
kingdom of 
heaven's changed i hope the 
children there 
won't be new fashioned when i come  
and laugh at me  and stare i hope the 
father in the skies 
will lift his little girl  
old fashioned  naught  everything  
over the stile of 
pearl
