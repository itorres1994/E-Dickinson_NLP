pigmy seraphs  gone astray  
velvet people from 
vevay  
balles from some lost summer day  
bees exclusive 
coterie  
paris could not lay the fold 
belted down with 
emerald  
venice could not show a check 
of a tint so lustrous meek  
never such an 
ambuscade 
as of briar and leaf displayed 
for my little damask maid i had rather wear her grace 
than an 
earl's distinguished face i had rather dwell like her 
than be 
duke of 
exeter  
royalty enough for me 
to subdue the bumblebee
