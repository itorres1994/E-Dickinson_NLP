if i could bribe them by a 
rose 
i'd bring them every flower that grows 
from 
amherst to 
cashmere i would not stop for night or storm  
or frost or death or anyone  
my business were so dear
if they would linger for a 
bird 
my 
tambourin were soonest heard 
among the 
april 
woods 
unwearied all the summer long 
only to break in wilder song 
when 
winter shook the boughs
what if they hear me 
who shall say 
that such an importunity 
may not at last avail
that weary of this 
beggar's face  
they may not finally say 
yes  
to drive her from the hall
