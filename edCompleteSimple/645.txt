bereavement in their death to feel 
whom 
we have never seen  
a 
vital 
kinsmanship import 
our 
soul and theirs  between for 
stranger  
strangers do not mourn  
there be 
immortal friends 
whom 
death see first  'tis news of this 
that paralyze 
ourselves who vital only to 
our 
thought  
such 
presence bear away 
in dying  'tis as if 
our 
souls 
absconded  suddenly
