he were living  dare i ask  
and how if 
he be dead  
and so around the 
words i went  
of meeting them  afraid i hinted 
changes  
lapse of 
time  
the 
surfaces of 
years  i touched with 
caution  lest they crack  
and show me to my fears reverted to adjoining 
lives  
adroitly turning out 
wherever i suspected

in face of the 
suspense  
was buried  
buried 
he 
my 
life just holds the 
trench
