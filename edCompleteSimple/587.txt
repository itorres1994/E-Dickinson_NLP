empty my 
heart  of 
thee  
its single 
artery  
begin  and leave 
thee out  
simply 
extinction's 
date much 
billow hath the 
sea  
one 
baltic  
they  
subtract 
thyself  in play  
and not enough of me 
is left  to put away   
myself  meanth 
thee erase the 
root  no 
tree  
thee  then  no me  
the 
heavens stripped  
eternity's vast pocket  picked
