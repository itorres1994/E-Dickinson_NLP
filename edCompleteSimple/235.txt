the 
court is far away  
no 
umpire  have i  
my 
sovereign is offended  
to gain his grace  
i'd die
i'll seek his royal feet  
i'll say  
remember  
king  
thou shalt  thyself  one day  a 
child  
implore a larger  thing that 
empire  is of 
czars  
as small  they say  as i  
grant me  that day  the royalty  
to intercede  for 
thee
