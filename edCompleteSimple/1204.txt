1204

whatever it is  she has tried it  
awful 
father of 
love  
is not 
ours the chastising  
do not chastise the 
dove not for 
ourselves petition  
nothing is left to pray  
when a subject is finished  
words are handed away only lest she be lonely 
in thy beautiful 
house 
give her for her 
transgression 
license to think of us
