death sets a 
thing significant 
the 
eye had hurried by 
except a perished 
creature 
entreat us tenderly
to ponder little 
workmanships 
in 
crayon or in 
wool 
with 
this was last 
her fingers did industrious until the 
thimble weighed too heavy  
the stitches stopped  by themselves  
and then 'twas put among the 
dust 
upon the 
closet shelves a 
book i have  a friend gave  
whose 
pencil  here and there  
had notched the place that pleased 
him  
at 
rest  
his fingers are now  when i read  i read not  
for interrupting 
tears  
obliterate the 
etchings 
too 
costly for repairs
