all forgot for recollecting 
just a paltry 
one  
all forsook for just a 
stranger's 
new 
accompanying grace of 
wealth and 
grace of 
station 
less accounted than 
an unknown 
esteem possessing  
estimate  
who can home effaced  
her faces dwindled  
nature  altered small  
sun  if shone  or 
storm  if shattered  
overlooked i all  
dropped  my fate  a timid 
pebble  
in thy bolder 
sea  
prove  me  
sweet  if i regret it prove 
myself  of 
thee
