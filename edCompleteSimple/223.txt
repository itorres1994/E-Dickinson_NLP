i 
came to buy a smile  today  
but just a single smile  
the smallest one upon your face 
will suit me just as well  
the one that no one else would miss 
it shone so very small  
i'm pleading at the counter  sir  
could you afford to sell  
i've 
diamonds  on my fingers  
you know what 
diamonds are 
i've 
rubies  live the 
evening 
blood  
and 
topaz  like the star '
twould be a 
bargain for a 
jew 
say  may i have it  sir
