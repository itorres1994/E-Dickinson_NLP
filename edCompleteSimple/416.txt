a 
murmur in the 
trees  to note  
not loud enough  for 
wind  
a 
star  not far enough to seek  
nor near enough  to find a long  long 
yellow  on the 
lawn  
a 
hubbub  as of feet  
not audible  as 
ours  to 
us  
but dapperer  
more 
sweet a 
hurrying 
home of little 
men 
to 
houses unperceived  
all this  and more  if i should tell would never be believed of 
robins in the 
trundle bed 
how many i espy 
whose 
nightgowns could not hide the 
wings  
although i heard them try but then i promised ne'er to tell  
how could i break 
my 
word 
so go your 
way  and 
i'll go 
mine  
no fear you'll miss the road
