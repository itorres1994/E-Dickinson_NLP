the 
luxury to apprehend 
the 
luxury 'twould be 
to look at 
thee a single time 
an 
epicure of me
in whatsoever 
presence makes 
till for a further 
food i scarcely recollect to starve 
so first am i supplied the 
luxury to meditate 
the 
luxury it was 
to banguet on thy 
countenance 
a 
sumptuousness bestows
on plainer 
days whose 
table far 
as 
certainty can see 
is laden with a single 
crumb 
the 
consciousness of thee
