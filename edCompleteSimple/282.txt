how noteless 
men and 
pleiads stand 
until a sudden sky 
reveals the fact that 
one is rapt 
forever from the 
eye  
members of the 
invisible 
existing while we stare 
in 
leagueless 
opportunity 
o'ertakenless as the 
air why didn't we detain 
them 
the 
heavens with a smile 
sweep by our disappointed 
heads 
without a syllable
