because i could not stop for 
death  
he kindly stopped for me  
the 
carriage held but just 
ourselves  
and immortality
we slowly drove  
he knew no haste 
and i had put away 
my labor and my leisure too 
for 
his 
civility we passed the 
school where 
children strove 
at 
recess  in the 
ring  
we passed the 
fields of 
gazing 
grain  
we passed the 
setting 
sun or rather  
he passed 
us  
the 
dews drew quivering and chill  
for only 
gossamer my 
gown  
my 
tippet  only 
tulle we paused before a 
house that seemed 
a 
swelling of the 
ground  
the 
roof was scarcely visible  
the 
cornice  in the 
ground since then  'tis 
centuries  and yet 
feels shorter than the 
day i first surmised the 
horses' 
heads 
were toward 
eternity
