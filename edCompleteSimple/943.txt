a 
coffin  is a small 
domain 
yet able to contain 
a 
citizen of 
paradise 
in it diminished plane
a 
grave  is a restricted 
breadth  
yet ampler than the 
sun  
and all the 
seas 
he populates 
and 
lands 
he looks upon
to 
him who on its small 
repose 
bestows a single 
friend  
circumference without 
relief  
or 
estimate  or 
end
