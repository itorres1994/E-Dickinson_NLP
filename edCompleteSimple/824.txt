the 
wind begun to knead the 
grass  
as 
women do a 
dough  
he flung a 
hand full at the 
plain  
a 
hand full at the 
sky  
the 
leaves unhooked themselves from 
trees  
and started all abroad  
the 
dust did scoop itself like 
hands  
and throw away the 
road  
the 
wagons  quickened on the 
street  
the 
thunders gossiped low  
the 
lightning showed a 
yellow 
head  
and then a livid 
toe  
the 
birds put up the 
bars to 
nests  
the 
cattle flung to 
barns  
then came one drop of 
giant 
rain  
and then  as if the 
hands 
that held the 
dams  had parted hold  
the 
waters 
wrecked the 
sky  
but overlooked my 
father's 
house  
just 
quartering a 
tree
