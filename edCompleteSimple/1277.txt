while we were fearing it  it came  
but came with less of fear 
because that fearing it so long 
had almost made it fair  
there is a 
fitting  a 
dismay  
a 
fitting  a 
despair '
tis harder knowing it is 
due 
than knowing it is here 
they 
trying on the 
utmost 
the 
morning it is new 
is 
terribler than wearing it 
a whole existence through
