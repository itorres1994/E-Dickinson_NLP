1097

dew  is the 
freshet in the 
grass  '
tis many a tiny 
mill 
turns unperceived beneath our feet 
and 
artisan lies still we spy the 
forests and the 
hills 
the 
tents to 
nature's 
show 
mistake the 
outside for the in 
and mention what we saw
could 
commentators on the 
sign 
of 
nature's 
caravan 
obtain 
admission as a 
child 
some 
wednesday afternoon
