of all the 
souls that stand create  i have elected  
one  
when 
sense from 
spirit  files away  
and 
subterfuge  is done  
when that which is  and that which was  
apart  intrinsic  stand  
and this brief 
drama in the flesh  
is shifted  like a 
sand  
when 
figures show their royal 
front  
and 
mists  are carved away 
behold the 
atom  i preferred  
to all the lists of clay
