i had no 
cause to be awake  
my 
best  was gone to sleep  
and 
morn a new politeness took  
and failed to wake them up but called the others  clear  
and passed their 
curtains by  
sweet 
morning  when i oversleep  
knock  
recollect  to 
me i looked at 
sunrise  
once  
and then i looked at 
them  
and wishfulness in me arose  
for 
circumstance the same  '
twas such an 
ample 
peace  
it could not hold a 
sigh  '
twas 
sabbath  with the 
bells divorced  '
twas 
sunset  all the 
day so choosing but a 
gown  
and taking but a 
prayer  
the only 
raiment i should need  i struggled  and was 
there
