we grow accustomed to the 
dark  
when light is put away  
as when the 
neighbor holds the 
lamp 
to witness her 
goodbye a 
moment  
we uncertain step 
for newness of the night  
then  fit our 
vision to the 
dark  
and meet the 
road  erect and so of larger  
darkness  
those 
evenings of the 
brain  
when not a 
moon disclose a sign or 
star  come out  within the 
bravest  grope a little  
and sometimes hit a 
tree 
directly in the 
forehead  
but as they learn to see either the 
darkness alters  
or something in the sight 
adjusts itself to 
midnight  
and 
life steps almost straight
