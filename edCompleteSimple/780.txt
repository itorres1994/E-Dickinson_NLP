the 
truth  is stirless  
other force  may be presumed to move  
this  then  is best for confidence when oldest 
cedars swerve and 
oaks untwist their fists  
and 
mountains  feeble  lean  
how excellent a 
body that 
stands without a 
bone how vigorous a 
force 
that holds without a 
prop  
truth stays 
herself  and every man 
that trusts 
her  boldly up
