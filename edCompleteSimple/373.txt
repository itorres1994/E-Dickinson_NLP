i'm saying every day  
if i should be a 
queen  tomorrow   
i'd do this way  
and so i deck  a little 
if it be  i wake a 
bourbon  
none on me  bend supercilious  
with  
this was she  
begged in the 
market place  yesterday  
court is a stately place  
i've heard men say  
so i loop my apron  against the 
majesty 
with bright 
pins of 
buttercup  
that not too plain  
rank  overtake me  
and perch my 
tongue 
on 
twigs of singing  rather high but this  might be my brief 
term 
to qualify put from my simple speech all plain word  
take other accents  as such i heard 
though but for the 
cricket  just  
and but for the 
bee  
not in all the 
meadow  
one accost me better to be ready  
than did next morn 
meet me in 
aragon  
my old 
gown  on and the surprised 
air 
rustics  wear  
summoned  unexpectedly  
to 
exeter
