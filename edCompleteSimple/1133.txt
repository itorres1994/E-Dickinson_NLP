1133

the 
snow that never drifts  
the transient fragrant snow 
that comes a single time a 
year 
is softly driving now so thorough in the 
tree 
at night beneath the star 
that it was 
february's 
foot 
experience would swear like 
winter as a 
face 
we stern and former knew 
repaired of all but 
loneliness 
by 
nature's 
alibit were every storm so spice 
the 
value could not be we buy with contrast  
pang is good 
as near as memory
