'twas warm  at first  like 
us  
until there crept upon 
a 
chill  like frost upon a 
glass  
till all the scene  be gone
the 
forehead copied 
stone  
the 
fingers grew too cold 
to ache  and like a 
skater's 
brook  
the busy eyes  congealed it straightened  that was all  
it crowded 
cold to 
cold  
it multiplied indifference as 
pride were all it could and even when with 
cords  '
twas lowered like a 
weight  
it made no 
signal nor demurred 
but dropped like adamant
