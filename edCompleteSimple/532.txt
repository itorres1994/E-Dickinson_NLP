i tried to think a lonelier 
thing 
than any i had seen  
some 
polar 
expiation  
an 
omen in the 
bone 
of 
death's tremendous nearness i probed 
retrieverless things 
my 
duplicate  to borrow  
a 
haggard 
comfort springs
from the belief that 
somewhere  
within the 
clutch of 
thought  
there dwells one other 
creature 
of 
heavenly 
love  forgot i plucked at our 
partition 
as 
one should pry the 
walls  
between 
himself  and 
horror's 
twin  
within 
opposing 
cells i almost strove to clasp his 
hand 
such 
luxury  it grew  
that as 
myself  could pity 
him  
perhaps he  pitied me
