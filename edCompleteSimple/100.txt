a science  so the 
savants say   
comparative 
anatomy   
by which a single bone  
is made a secret to unfold 
of some rare tenant of the mold  
else perished in the stone so to the eye prospective led  
this meekest flower of the mead 
upon a winter's day  
stands representative in gold 
of 
rose and 
lily  manifold  
and countless butterfly
