i could suffice for 
him i knew  
he  could suffice for 
me  
yet 
hesitating 
fractions  
both 
surveyed 
infinity 
would i be 
whole 
he sudden broached  
my syllable rebelled  '
twas face to face with 
nature  forced  '
twas face to face with 
god withdrew the 
sun  to 
other 
wests  
withdrew the furthest 
star 
before 
decision  stooped to speech  
and then  be audibler 
the 
answer of the 
sea unto 
the 
motion of the 
moon  
herself adjust 
her 
tides  unto  
could i  do else  with mine
