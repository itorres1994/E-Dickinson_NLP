403

the 
winters are so short  
i'm hardly justified 
in sending all the 
birds away  
and moving into 
pod myself  for scarcely settled  
the 
phoebes have begun  
and then  it's time to strike my 
tent  
and open 
house  again it's mostly interruptions  
my 
summer  is despoiled  
because there was a 
winter  once  
and al the 
cattle  starved and so there was a 
deluge  
and swept the 
world away  
but 
ararat's a 
legend  now  
and no one credits 
noah
