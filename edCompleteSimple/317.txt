317

just so  
jesus  raps  
he  doesn't weary  
last  at the 
knocker  
and first  at the 
bell  
then  on divinest tiptoe  standing  
might 
he but spy the lady's soul  
when 
he  retires  
chilled  or weary  
it will be ample time for  me  
patient  upon the steps  until then  
hears  i am knocking  low at thee
