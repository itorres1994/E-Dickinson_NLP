the feet of people walking home 
with gayer sandals go  
the 
crocus  till she rises 
the 
vassal of the snow  
the lips at 
hallelujah 
long years of practise bore 
till bye and bye these 
bargemen 
walked singing on the shore
pearls are the 
diver's farthings 
extorted from the 
sea  
pinions  the 
seraph's wagon 
pedestrian once  as we  
night is the morning's 
canvas 
larceny  legacy  
death but our rapt attention 
to immortality
my figures fail to tell me 
how far the 
village lies  
whose peasants are the 
angels  
whose 
cantons dot the skies  
my 
classics veil their faces  
my faith that 
dark adores  
which from its solemn abbeys 
such resurection pours
