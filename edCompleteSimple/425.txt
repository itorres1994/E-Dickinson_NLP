good 
morning  
midnight  
i'm coming 
home  
day  got tired of 
me  
how could i  of him 
sunshine was a sweet place  i liked to stay  
but 
morn  didn't want me  now  
so  
goodnight  day 
i can look  can't i  
when the 
east is 
red  
the 
hills  have a way  then  
that puts the 
heart  abroad you  are not so fair  
midnight  i chose  
day  
but  please take a little 
girl  
he turned away
