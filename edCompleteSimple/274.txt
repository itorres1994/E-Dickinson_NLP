the only 
ghost i ever saw 
was dressed in 
mechlin  so  
he wore no sandal on his foot  
and stepped like flakes of snow his 
gait  was soundless like the 
bird  
but rapid  like the 
roe  
his fashions quaint 
mosaic  
or haply 
mistletoe his conversation  seldom  
his laughter like the 
breeze  
that dies away in 
dimples 
among the pensive 
trees our interview  was transient  
of me himself was shy  
and 
god forbid i look behind  
since that appalling day
