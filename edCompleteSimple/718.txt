i meant to find 
her when i came  
death  had the same design  
but the 
success  was 
his  it seems  
and the 
surrender  
mine i meant to tell 
her how i longed 
for just this single time  
but 
death had told 
her so the first and she had past with 
him to wander  now  is my 
repose  
to rest  
to rest would be 
a privilege of 
hurricane 
to 
memory  and me
