1642

red 
sea indeed 
talk not to me 
of purple 
pharaoh  i have a 
navy in the 
west 
would pierce his 
columns thro'  
guileless yet of such 
glory fine 
that all along the 
line 
is it or is it not divine  
the 
eye inquires with a sigh 
that 
earth sh'd be so big  
what 
exultation in the 
woe  
what 
wine in the fatigue
