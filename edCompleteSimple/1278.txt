1278

the 
mountains stood in 
haze  
the 
valleys stopped below 
and went or waited as they liked 
the 
river and the sky
at leisure was the 
sun  
his interests of 
fire 
a little from remark withdrawn  
the 
twilight spoke the spire
so soft upon the 
scene 
the 
act of evening fell 
we felt how neighborly a 
thing 
was the invisible
