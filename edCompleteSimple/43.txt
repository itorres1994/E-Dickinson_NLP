could live  did live  
could die  did die  
could smile upon the whole 
through faith in one he met not 
to introduce his soul
could go from scene familiar 
to an untraversed spot  
could contemplate the journey 
with unpuzzled heart such trust had one among us 
among us not today  
we who saw the launching 
never sailed the bay
