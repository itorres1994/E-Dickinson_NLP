to disappear enhances the 
man that runs away 
is tinctured for an instant 
with immortality
but yesterday a 
vagrant  
today in 
memory lain 
with superstitious value 
we tamper with 
againbut 
never far as 
honor 
withdraws the 
worthless thing 
and impotent to cherish 
we hasten to adorn of 
death the sternest function 
that just as we discern 
the 
excellence defies us  
securest gathered then
the 
fruit perverse to plucking 
but leaning to the 
sight 
with the ecstatic limit 
of unobtained 
delight
