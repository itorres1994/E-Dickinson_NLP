1024

so large my 
will 
the little that i may 
embarrasses 
like gentle infamy affront to 
him 
for whom the 
whole were small 
affront to me 
who know 
his 
meed of all
earth at the best 
is but a scanty 
toy  
bought carried 
home 
to immortality
it looks so small 
we chiefly wonder then 
at our 
conceit 
in purchasing
