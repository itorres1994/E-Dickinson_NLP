the 
rose did caper on her cheek her 
bodice rose and fell  
her pretty speech  like drunken men  
did stagger pitiful her fingers fumbled at her work  
her needle would not go  
what ailed so smart a little 
maid  
it puzzled me to know  
till opposite  i spied a cheek 
that bore another 
rose  
just opposite  
another speech 
that like the 
drunkard goes a 
vest that like her 
bodice  danced to the immortal tune  
till those two troubled  little 
clocks 
ticked softly into one
