i felt my life with both my hands 
to see if it was there  i held my spirit to the 
glass  
to prove it possibler i turned my 
being round and round 
and paused at every pound 
to ask the 
owner's name  
for doubt  that i should know the 
sound i judged my features  jarred my hair  i pushed my dimples by  and waited  
if they  twinkled back  
conviction might  of me i told myself   
take 
courage  
friend  
that  was a former time  
but we might learn to like the 
heaven  
as well as our 
old home
