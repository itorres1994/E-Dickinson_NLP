they leave us with the 
infinite  
but 
he  is not a man  
his fingers are the size of fists  
his fists  the size of men and whom he foundeth  with his 
arm 
as 
himmaleh  shall stand  
gibraltar's 
everlasting 
shoe 
poised lightly on his 
hand  
so trust him  
comrade  
you for you  and 
i  for you and me 
eternity is ample  
and quick enough  if true
