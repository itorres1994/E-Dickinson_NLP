whose are the little beds  i asked 
which in the valleys lie  
some shook their heads  and others smiled  
and no one made reply  
perhaps they did not hear  i said  i will inquire again  
whose are the beds  the tiny beds 
so thick upon the plain '
tis 
daisy  in the shortest  
a little further on  
nearest the door  to wake the 
ist little leontoden '
tis 
iris  
sir  and 
aster  
anemone  and 
bell  
bartsia  in the blanket red  
and chubby daffodil 
meanwhile  at many cradles 
her busy foot she plied  
humming the quaintest lullaby 
that ever rocked a child 
hush  
epigea wakens  
the 
crocus stirs her lids  
rhodora's cheek is crimson  
she's dreaming of the woods 
then turning from them reverent  
their bedtime 'tis  she said  
the 
bumble bees will wake them 
when 
april woods are red
