because the 
bee may blameless hum 
for 
thee a 
bee do i become 
list even unto me 
because the 
flowers unafraid 
may lift a look on thine  a 
maid 
alway a 
flower would be 
nor 
robins  
robins need not hide 
when 
thou upon their 
crypts intrude 
so 
wings bestow on 
me 
or 
petals  or a 
dower of 
buzz 
that 
bee to ride  or 
flower of 
furze i that way worship thee
