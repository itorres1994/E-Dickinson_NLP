poor little 
heart  
did they forget thee  
then dinna care  
then dinna care 
proud little 
heart  
did they forsake thee  
be debonnaire  
be debonnaire 
frail little 
heart  i would not break thee  
could'st credit me  
could'st credit me 
gay little 
heart  
like 
morning 
glory  
wind and 
sun  wilt thee array
