the 
brain  is wider than the 
sky  
for  put them side by side  
the one the other will contain 
with ease  and 
you  beside the 
brain is deeper than the sea for  hold them  
blue to 
blue  
the one the other will absorb  
as 
sponges  
buckets  do the 
brain is just the weight of 
god  
for  
heft them  
pound for 
pound  
and they will differ  if they do  
as 
syllable from 
sound
