the 
crickets sang 
and set the 
sun 
and 
workmen finished one by one 
their 
seam the 
day upon 
the low 
grass loaded with the 
dew 
the 
twilight stood  as 
strangers do 
with 
hat in 
hand  polite and new 
to stay as if  or go 
a 
vastness  as a 
neighbor  came  
a 
wisdom  without 
face  or 
name  
a 
peace  as 
hemispheres at 
home 
and so the 
night became
