the 
judge is like the 
owl  
i've heard my 
father tell  
and 
owls do build in 
oaks  
so here's an 
amber 
sill that slanted in my 
path  
when going to the 
barn  
and if it serve 
you for a 
house  
itself is not in vain about the price  'tis small  i only ask a 
tune 
at 
midnight  
let the 
owl select 
his favorite refrain
