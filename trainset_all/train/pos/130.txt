these are the days when 
birds come back  
a very few  a 
bird or two  
to take a backward look 
these are the days when skies resume 
the old  old sophistries of 
june a blue and gold mistake 
oh fraud that cannot cheat the 
bee  
almost thy plausibility 
induces my belief 
till ranks of seeds their witness bear  
and softly thro' the altered air 
hurries a timid leaf 
oh 
sacrament of summer days  
oh 
last 
communion in the 
haze  
permit a child to join 
thy sacred emblems to partake  
they consecrated bread to take 
and thine immortal wine
