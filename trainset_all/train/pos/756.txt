one 
blessing had i than the rest 
so larger to my 
eyes 
that i stopped gauging  satisfied  
for this enchanted size it was the limit of my 
dream  
the focus of my 
prayer  
a perfect  paralyzing 
bliss  
contented as 
despair i knew no more of 
want  or 
cold  
phantasms both become 
for this new 
value in the 
soul  
supremest 
earthly 
sum the 
heaven below the 
heaven above  
obscured with ruddier 
blue  
life's 
latitudes leant over  full  
the 
judgment perished  too why 
bliss so scantily disburse  
why 
paradise defer  
why 
floods be served to 
us  in 
bowls  i speculate no more
