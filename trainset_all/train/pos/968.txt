fitter to see 
him  i may be 
for the long 
hindrance  
grace  to 
me  
with 
summers  and with 
winters  grow  
some passing 
year  
a trait bestow
to make 
me fairest of the 
earth  
the 
waiting  then  will seem so worth i shall impute with half a pain 
the blame that i was chosen  then time to anticipate 
his 
gaze  
it's first  
delight  and then  
surprise  
the turning o'er and o'er my face 
for 
evidence it be the 
grace he left behind 
one 
day  
so less 
he seek 
conviction  
that  be 
this i only must not grow so new 
that 
he'll mistake  and ask for me 
of me  when first unto the 
door i go  to 
elsewhere go no more i only must not change so fair 
he'll sigh   
the 
other  
she  is 
where   
the 
love  tho'  will array me right i shall be perfect  in 
his sight if 
he perceive the other 
truth  
upon an 
excellenter 
youth how sweet i shall not lack in 
vain  
but gain  thro' loss  
through 
grief  obtain the 
beauty that reward 
him best  
the 
beauty of 
demand  at 
rest
