1235

like 
rain it sounded till it curved 
and then i knew 'twas 
wind  
it walked as wet as any 
wave 
but swept as dry as sand  
when it had pushed itself away 
to some remotest 
plain 
a coming as of 
hosts was heard 
it filled the 
wells  it pleased the 
pools 
it warbled in the 
road  
it pulled the spigot from the 
hills 
and let the 
floods abroad  
it loosened acres  lifted seas 
the sites of 
centres stirred 
then like 
elijah rode away 
upon a 
wheel of cloud
