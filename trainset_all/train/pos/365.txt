dare you see a 
soul at the 
white 
heat  
then crouch within the door  
red  is the 
fire's common tint  
but when the vivid 
ore 
has vanquished 
flame's conditions  
it quivers from the 
forge 
without a color  but the light 
of unanointed 
blaze  
least 
village has its 
blacksmith 
whose 
anvil's even ring 
stands symbol for the finer 
forge 
that soundless tugs  within  
refining these impatient 
ores 
with 
hammer  and with 
blaze 
until the 
designated 
light 
repudiate the 
forge
