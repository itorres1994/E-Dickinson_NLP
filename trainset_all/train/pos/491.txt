while it is alive 
until 
death touches it 
while it and i lap one 
air 
dwell in one 
blood 
under one 
sacrament 
show me 
division can split or pare love is like 
life  merely longer 
love is like 
death  during the 
grave 
love is the 
fellow of the 
resurrection 
scooping up the 
dust and chanting  live
