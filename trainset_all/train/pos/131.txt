besides the 
autumn poets sing 
a few prosaic days 
a little this side of the snow 
and that side of the 
haze a few incisive 
mornings  
a few 
ascetic 
eves  
gone  
mr  
bryant's  
golden 
rod   
and 
mr  
thomson's  sheaves  
still  is the bustle in the 
brook  
sealed are the spicy valves  
mesmeric fingers softly touch 
the 
eyes of many 
elves perhaps a squirrel may remain  
my sentiments to share  
grant me  
oh 
lord  a sunny mind  
thy windy will to bear
