a 
bird came down the 
walk  
he did not know i saw  
he bit an 
angleworm in halves 
and ate the fellow  raw 
and then he drank a 
dew 
from a convenient 
grass  
and then hopped sidewise to the 
wall 
to let a 
beetle pass he glanced with rapid eyes 
that hurried all around they looked like frightened 
beads  i thought  
he stirred his 
velvet head
like one in danger  
cautious  i offered him a 
crumb 
and he unrolled his feathers 
and rowed him softer home than 
oars divide the 
ocean  
too silver for a seam  
or 
butterflies  off 
banks of 
noon 
leap  plashless as they swim
