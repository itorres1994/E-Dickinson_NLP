a fuzzy fellow  without feet  
yet doth exceeding run  
of velvet  is his 
countenance  
and his 
complexion  dun 
sometime  he dwelleth in the grass  
sometime  upon a bough  
from which he doth descend in plush 
upon the passerby 
all this in summer  
but when winds alarm the 
forest 
folk  
he taketh 
damask 
residence  
and struts in sewing silk 
then  finer than a 
lady  
emerges in the spring  
a 
feather on each shoulder  
you'd scarce recognize him 
by 
men  yclept 
caterpillar  
by me  
but who am 
i  
to tell the pretty secret 
of the butterfly
