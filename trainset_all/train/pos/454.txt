it was given to me by the 
gods  
when i was a little 
girl  
they given us 
presents most  you know  
when we are new  and small  i kept it in my 
hand  i never put it down  i did not dare to eat  or sleep  
for fear it would be gone  i heard such words as  
rich   
when hurrying to school  
from lips at 
corners of the 
streets  
and wrestled with a smile  
rich  '
twas 
myself  was rich  
to take the name of 
gold  
and 
gold to own  in solid 
bars  
the 
difference  made me bold
