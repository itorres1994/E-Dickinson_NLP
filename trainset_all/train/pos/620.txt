it makes no difference abroad  
the 
seasons  fit  the same  
the 
mornings blossom into 
noons  
and split their 
pods of 
flame  
wild flowers  kindle in the 
woods the 
brooks slam  all the 
day  
no 
black bird bates his 
banjo  
for passing 
calvary auto da 
fe  and 
judgment  
are nothing to the 
bee  
his separation from 
his 
rose  
to 
him  sums 
misery
