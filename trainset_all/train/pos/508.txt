i'm ceded  
i've stopped being 
theirs  
the name 
they dropped upon my face 
with water  in the country church 
is finished using  now  
and 
they can put it with my 
dolls  
my childhood  and the string of spools  
i've finished threading  too baptized  before  without the choice  
but this time  consciously  of 
grace  
unto supremest name  
called to my 
full  
the 
crescent dropped  
existence's whole 
arc  filled up  
with one small diadem 
my second 
rank  too small the first  
crowned  
crowing  on my 
father's breast  
a half unconscious 
queen  
but this time  
adequate  
erect  
with 
will to choose  or to reject  
and i choose  just a 
crown
