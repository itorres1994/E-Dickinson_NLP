my 
worthiness is all my 
doubt  
his 
merit  all my fear  
contrasting which  my quality 
do lowlier  appear lest i should insufficient prove 
for 
his beloved 
need  
the 
chiefest 
apprehension 
upon my thronging 
mind '
tis true  that 
deity to stoop 
inherently incline  
for nothing higher than 
itself 
itself can rest upon so i  the undivine abode 
of 
his 
elect 
content  
conform my 
soul  as 'twere a 
church  
unto 
her 
sacrament
