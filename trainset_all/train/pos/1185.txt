a little 
dog that wags his tail 
and knows no other joy 
of such a little 
dog am i 
reminded by a boy
who gambols all the living 
day 
without an earthly cause 
because he is a little 
boy i honestly suppose the 
cat that in the 
corner dwells 
her martial 
day forgot 
the 
mouse but a 
tradition now 
of her desireless lot
another class remind me 
who neither please nor play 
but not to make a  bit of noise  
beseech each little 
boy
