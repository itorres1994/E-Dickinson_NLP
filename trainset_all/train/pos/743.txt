the 
birds reported from the 
south  
a 
news express to 
me  
a spicy 
charge  
my little 
posts  
but i am deaf  
today the 
flowers  appealed  a timid 
throng  i reinforced the 
door  
go blossom for the 
bees  i said  
and trouble 
me  no 
more the 
summer 
grace  for 
notice strove  
remote  
her best 
array  
the 
heart  to stimulate the 
eye 
refused too utterly at length  a 
mourner  like 
myself  
she drew away austere  
her frosts to ponder  then it was i recollected 
her she suffered 
me  for i had mourned  i offered 
her no word  
my 
witness  was the 
crape i bore  
her  
witness  was 
her 
dead thenceforward  
we  together dwelt  i never questioned 
her  
our 
contract 
a 
wiser sympathy
