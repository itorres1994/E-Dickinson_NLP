of 
being is a 
bird 
the likest to the 
down 
an 
easy 
breeze do put afloat 
the 
general 
heavens  upon it soars  and shifts  and whirls and measures with the 
clouds 
in easy  even  dazzling pace  
no different the 
birds  
except a 
wake of 
music 
accompany their feet  
as did the 
down emit a 
tune  
for 
ecstasy  of it
