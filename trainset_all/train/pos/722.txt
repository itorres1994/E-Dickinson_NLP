sweet 
mountains  
ye tell 
me no lie  
never deny 
me  
never fly  
those same unvarying 
eyes 
turn on 
me  when i fail  or feign  
or take the 
royal names in vain  
their far  slow  
violet 
gaze my 
strong 
madonnas  
cherish still  
the 
wayward 
nun  beneath the 
hill  
whose service  is to 
you  
her latest 
worship  
when the 
day 
fades from the 
firmament away  
to lift 
her 
brows on 
you
