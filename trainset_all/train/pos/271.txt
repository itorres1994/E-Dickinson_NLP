a solemn thing  it was  i said  
a woman  white  to be  
and wear  if 
god should count me fit  
her blameless mystery a hallowed thing  to drop a life 
into the purple well  
too plummetless  that it return  
eternity  until i pondered how the bliss would look  
and would it feel as big  
when i could take it in my hand  
as hovering  seen  through fog and then  the size of this  small  life  
the 
sages  call it small  
swelled  like 
horizons  in my vest  
and i sneered  softly   small
