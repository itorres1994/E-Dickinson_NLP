the 
day undressed  
herself  
her 
garter  was of 
gold  
her 
petticoat  of 
purple plain  
her 
dimities  as old
exactly  as the 
world  
and yet the newest 
star  
enrolled upon the 
hemisphere 
be wrinkled  much as 
her  
too near to 
god  to pray  
too near to 
heaven  to fear  
the 
lady of the 
occident 
retired without a care her 
candle so expire 
the flickering be seen 
on 
ball of 
mast in 
bosporus  
and 
dome  and 
window
