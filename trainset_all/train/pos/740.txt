you taught me 
waiting with 
myself  
appointment strictly kept  
you taught me fortitude of 
fate  
this  also  i have learnt an 
altitude of 
death  that could 
no bitterer debar 
than 
life  had done  before it  
yet  there is a 
science more the 
heaven you know  to understand 
that you be not ashamed 
of 
me  in 
christ's bright 
audience 
upon the further 
hand
