it will be 
summer  eventually  
ladies  with parasols  
sauntering 
gentlemen  with 
canes  
and little 
girls  with 
dolls will tint the pallid landscape  
as 'twere a bright 
bouquet  
thro' drifted deep  in 
parian  
the 
village lies  today the 
lilacs  bending many a year  
will sway with purple load  
the 
bees  will not despise the tune  
their 
forefathers  have hummed the 
wild 
rose  redden in the 
bog  
the 
aster  on the 
hill 
her everlasting fashion  set  
and 
covenant 
gentians  frill till 
summer folds her miracle  
as 
women  do  their 
gown  
of 
priests  adjust the 
symbols  
when 
sacrament  is done
