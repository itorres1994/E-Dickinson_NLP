this is a 
blossom of the 
brain  
a small  italic 
seed 
lodged by 
design or 
happening 
the 
spirit fructified shy as the 
wind of his 
chambers 
swift as a 
freshet's 
tongue 
so of the 
flower of the 
soul 
its process is unknown 
when it is found  a few rejoice 
the 
wise convey it 
home 
carefully cherishing the spot 
if other 
flower become 
when it is lost  that 
day shall be 
the 
funeral of 
god  
upon his 
breast  a closing 
soul 
the 
flower of our lord
