some  too fragile for winter winds 
the thoughtful grave encloses  
tenderly tucking them in from frost 
before their feet are cold 
never the treasures in her nest

and sportsman is not bold 
this covert have all the children 
early aged  and often cold  
sparrow  unnoticed by the 
father  
lambs for whom time had not a fold
