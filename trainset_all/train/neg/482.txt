we 
cover 
thee  
sweet 
face  
not that 
we tire of 
thee  
but that 
thyself fatigue of 
us  
remember  as 
thou go  
we follow 
thee until 
thou notice 
us  no more  
and then  reluctant  turn away 
to 
con 
thee o'er and o'er and blame the scanty love 
we were 
content to show  
augmented  
sweet  a 
hundred fold  
if 
thou would'st take it  now
