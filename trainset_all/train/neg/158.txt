dying  
dying in the night  
won't somebody bring the light 
so i can see which way to go 
into the everlasting snow 
and  
jesus   
where is 
jesus gone  
they said that 
jesus  always came  
perhaps he doesn't know the 
house  
this way  
jesus  
let him pass 
somebody run to the great gate 
and see if 
dollie's coming  
wait  i hear her feet upon the stair  
death won't hurt  now 
dollie's here
