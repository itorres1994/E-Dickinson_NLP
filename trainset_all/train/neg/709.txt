publication  is the 
auction 
of the 
mind of 
man  
poverty  be justifying 
for so foul a thing
possibly  but 
we  would rather 
from 
our 
garret go 
white  
unto the 
white 
creator  
than invest  
our 
snow thought belong to 
him who gave it  
then  to 
him 
who bear 
its 
corporeal illustration  
sell 
the 
royal 
air in the 
parcel  
be the 
merchant 
of the 
heavenly 
grace  
but reduce no 
human 
spirit 
to 
disgrace of 
price
