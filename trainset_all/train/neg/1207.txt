he preached upon  
breadth  till it argued him narrow  
the 
broad are too broad to define 
and of  
truth  until it proclaimed him a 
liar  
the 
truth never flaunted a 
sign simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence 
as 
gold the 
pyrites would shun  
what confusion would cover the innocent 
jesus 
to meet so enabled a 
man
