what i see not  i better see  
through 
faith  my 
hazel 
eye 
has periods of shutting but  
no lid has 
memory for frequent  all my sense obscured i equally behold 
as someone held a light unto 
the 
features so beloved and i arise  and in my 
dream  
do 
thee distinguished 
grace  
till jealous 
daylight interrupt  
and mar thy perfectness
