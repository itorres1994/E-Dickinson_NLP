1099

my 
cocoon tightens  
colors tease i'm feeling for the 
air  
a dim capacity for 
wings 
demeans the 
dress i wear a power of 
butterfly must be  
the 
aptitude to fly 
meadows of 
majesty implies 
and easy 
sweeps of 
sky so i must baffle at the 
hint 
and cipher at the 
sign 
and make much blunder  if at least i take the clue divine
