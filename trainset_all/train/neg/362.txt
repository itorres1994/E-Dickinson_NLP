it struck me  every 
day  
the 
lightning was as new 
as if the 
cloud that instant slit 
and let the 
fire through it burned 
me  in the 
night  
it 
blistered to 
my 
dream  
it sickened fresh upon my sight  
with every 
morn that came i though that 
storm  was brief  
the 
maddest  quickest by  
but 
nature lost the 
date of 
this  
and left it in the 
sky
