the 
tint i cannot take  is best  
the 
color too remote 
that i could show it in 
bazaar  
a 
guinea at a sight the fine  impalpable 
array  
that swaggers on the eye 
like 
cleopatra's 
company  
repeated  in the sky the 
moments of 
dominion 
that happen on the 
soul 
and leave it with a 
discontent 
too exquisite  to tell the eager look  on 
landscapes as if they just repressed 
some 
secret  that was pushing 
like 
chariots  in the 
vest the 
pleading of the 
summer  
that other 
prank  of 
snow  
that 
cushions 
mystery with 
tulle  
for fear the 
squirrels  know 
their 
graspless manners  mock us  
until the 
cheated 
eye 
shuts arrogantly  in the 
grave  
another way  to see
