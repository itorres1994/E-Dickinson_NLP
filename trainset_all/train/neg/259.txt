good 
night  
which put the 
candle out  
a jealous 
zephyr  not a doubt  
ah  friend  you little knew 
how long at that celestial wick 
the 
angels  labored diligent  
extinguished  now  for you 
it might  have been the 
light 
house spark  
some 
sailor  rowing in the 
dark  
had importuned to see  
it might  have been the waning lamp 
that lit the 
drummer from the 
camp 
to purer reveille
