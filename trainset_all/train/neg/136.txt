have you got a 
brook in your little heart  
where bashful flowers blow  
and blushing birds go down to drink  
and shadows tremble so and nobody knows  so still it flows  
that any brook is there  
and yet your little draught of life 
is daily drunken there why  look out for the little brook in 
march  
when the rivers overflow  
and the snows come hurrying from the fills  
and the bridges often go and later  in 
august it may be  
when the meadows parching lie  
beware  lest this little brook of life  
some burning noon go dry
