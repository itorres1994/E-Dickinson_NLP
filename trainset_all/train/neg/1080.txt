when they come back  if 
blossoms do  i always feel a doubt 
if 
blossoms can be born again 
when once the 
art is out when they begin  if 
robins may  i always had a fear i did not tell  it was their last 
experiment 
last year 
when it is 
may  if 
may return  
had nobody a pang 
lest in a 
face so beautiful 
he might not look again 
if i am there  
one does not know 
what 
party  
one may be 
tomorrow  but if i am there i take back all i say
