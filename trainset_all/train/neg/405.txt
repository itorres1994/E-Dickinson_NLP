it might be lonelier 
without the 
loneliness  
i'm so accustomed to my 
fate  
perhaps the 
other  
peace would interrupt the 
dark  
and crowd the little 
room  
too scant  by 
cubits  to contain 
the 
sacrament  of 
him i am not used to 
hope  
it might intrude upon  
its sweet parade  blaspheme the place  
ordained to 
suffering it might be easier 
to fail  with 
land in 
sight  
than gain  
my 
blue 
peninsula  
to perish  of 
delight
