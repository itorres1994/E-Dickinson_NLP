no matter  now  
sweet  
but when 
i'm 
earl  
won't you wish you'd spoken 
to that dull girl 
trivial a 
word  just  
trivial  a 
smile  
but won't you wish you'd spared one 
when 
i'm earl 
i shan't need it  then crests  will do  
eagles on my 
buckles  
on my 
belt  too ermine  my familiar 
gown  
say  
sweet  then 
won't you wish you'd smiled  just me upon
