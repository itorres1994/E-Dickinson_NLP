kill your 
balm  and its 
odors bless you  
bare your 
jessamine  to the storm  
and she will fling her maddest perfume  
haply  your 
summer night to 
charm stab the 
bird  that built in your bosom  
oh  could you catch her last 
refrain  
bubble   forgive    
some better   
bubble   
carol for 
him  when i am gone
