a single 
screw of 
flesh 
is all that pins the 
soul 
that stands for 
deity  to 
mine  
upon my side the 
veil once witnessed of the 
gauze  
its name is put away 
as far from mine  as if no plight 
had printed yesterday 
in tender  solemn 
alphabet  
my eyes just turned to see  
when it was smuggled by my sight 
into 
eternity more 
hands  to hold  
these are but 
two  
one more newmailed 
nerve 
just granted  for the 
peril's sake  
some striding  
giant  
love so greater than the 
gods can show  
they slink before the 
clay  
that not for all their 
heaven can boast 
will let its 
keepsake  go
