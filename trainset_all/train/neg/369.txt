she lay as if at play 
her life had leaped away  
intending to return  
but not so soon her merry 
arms  half dropt  
as if for lull of sport  
an instant had forgot  
the 
trick to start her dancing 
eyes  ajar  
as if their 
owner were 
still sparkling through 
for fun  at you her 
morning at the door  
devising  i am sure  
to force her sleep  
so light  so deep
