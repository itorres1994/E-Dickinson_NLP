236

if 
he dissolve  then  there is nothing  more  
eclipse  at 
midnight  
it was dark  before  
sunset  at 
easter  
blindness  on the 
dawn  
faint 
star of 
bethlehem  
gone down 
would but some 
god  inform 
him  
or it be too late  
say  that the pulse just lisps  
the 
chariots wait  
say  that a little life  for 
his  
is leaking  red  
his little 
spaniel  tell 
him  
will 
he heed
