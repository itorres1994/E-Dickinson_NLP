no 
man can compass a 
despair  
as round a 
goalless 
road 
no faster than a 
mile at once 
the 
traveller proceed unconscious of the 
width  
unconscious that the 
sun 
be setting on 
his progress  
so accurate the one
at estimating 
pain  
whose own  has just begun  
his ignorance  the 
angel 
that pilot 
him along
