going to 
heaven  i don't know when  
pray do not ask me how  
indeed 
i'm too astonished 
to think of answering you  
going to 
heaven  
how dim it sounds  
and yet it will be done 
as sure as flocks go home at night 
unto the 
shepherd's arm 
perhaps you're going too  
who knows  
if you should get there first 
save just a little space for me 
close to the two i lost  
the smallest  
robe  will fit me 
and just a bit of  
crown   
for you know we do not mind our dress 
when we are going home i'm glad i don't believe it 
for it would stop my breath  
and 
i'd like to look a little more 
at such a curious 
earth  
i'm glad they did believe it 
whom i have never found 
since the might 
autumn afternoon i left them in the ground
