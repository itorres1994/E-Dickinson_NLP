'twas just this time  last year  i died  i know i heard the 
corn  
when i was carried by the 
farms  
it had the 
tassels on i thought how yellow it would look when 
richard went to mill  
and then  i wanted to get out  
but something held my will 
i thought just how 
red  
apples wedged 
the 
stubble's joints between  
and the 
carts stooping round the fields 
to take the 
pumpkins in  i wondered which would miss me  least  
and when 
thanksgiving  came  
if 
father'd multiply the plates  
to make an even 
sum and would it blur the 
christmas glee 
my 
stocking hang too high 
for any 
santa 
claus to reach 
the 
altitude of me but this sort  grieved myself  
and so  i thought the other way  
how just this time  some perfect year  
themself  should come to me
