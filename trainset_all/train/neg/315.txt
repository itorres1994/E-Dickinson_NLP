he fumbles at your 
soul 
as 
players at the 
keys 
before they drop full 
music on  
he stuns you by degrees  
prepares your brittle 
nature 
for the 
ethereal 
blow 
by fainter 
hammers  further heard  
then nearer  
then so slow 
your 
breath has time to straighten your 
brain  to bubble 
cool  
deals  
one  imperial  
thunderbolt  
that scalps your naked 
soul  
when 
winds take 
forests in the 
paws  
the 
universe  is still
