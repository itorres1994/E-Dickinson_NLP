'tis 
one by 
one  the 
father counts  
and then a 
tract between 
set 
cypherless  to teach the 
eye 
the 
value of its 
ten until the peevish 
student 
acquire the 
quick of 
skill  
then 
numerals are dowered back adorning all the 
rule '
tis mostly 
slate and 
pencil  
and 
darkness on the 
school 
distracts the 
children's fingers  
still the 
eternal rule
regards least 
cypherer alike 
with 
leader of the 
band  
and every separate 
urchin's 
sum  
is fashioned for his hand
