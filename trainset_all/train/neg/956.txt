what shall i do when the 
summer troubles  
what  when the 
rose is ripe  
what when the 
eggs fly off in 
music 
from the 
maple keep 
what shall i do when the 
skies a'chirrup 
drop a 
tune on me  
when the 
bee hangs all 
noon in the 
buttercup 
what will become of me 
oh  when the 
squirrel fills 
his 
pockets 
and the 
berries stare 
how can i bear their jocund 
faces 
thou from 
here  so far '
twouldn't afflict a 
robin  
all 
his 
goods have 
wings  i  do not fly  so wherefore 
my 
perennial 
things
