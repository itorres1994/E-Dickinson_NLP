'tis so appalling  it exhilarates  
so over 
horror  it half 
captivates  
the 
soul stares after it  secure  
a 
sepulchre  fears frost  no more to scan a 
ghost  is faint  
but grappling  conquers it  
how easy  
torment  now  
suspense kept sawing so the 
truth  is 
bald  and 
cold  
but that will hold  
if any are not sure  
we show them  prayer  
but we  who know  
stop hoping  now looking at 
death  is 
dying  
just let go the 
breath  
and not the pillow at your 
cheek 
so 
slumbereth others  
can wrestle  
yours  is done  
and so of 
woe  bleak dreaded  come  
it sets the 
fright at liberty  
and 
terror's free  
gay  
ghastly  holiday
