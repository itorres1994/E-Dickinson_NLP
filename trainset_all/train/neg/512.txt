the 
soul has 
bandaged moments  
when too appalled to stir  
she feels some ghastly 
fright come up 
and stop to look at her salute her  with long fingers  
caress her freezing hair  
sip  
goblin  from the very lips 
the 
lover  hovered  o'er  
unworthy  that a thought so mean 
accost a 
theme  so  fair the soul has moments of 
escape when bursting all the doors  
she dances like a 
bomb  abroad  
and swings upon the hours 
as do the 
bee  delirious borne  
long 
dungeoned from his 
rose  
touch 
liberty  then know no more  
but 
noon  and 
paradise the 
soul's retaken moments  
when  
felon led along  
with shackles on the plumed feet  
and staples  in the 
song  
the 
horror welcomes her  again  
these  are not brayed of 
tongue
