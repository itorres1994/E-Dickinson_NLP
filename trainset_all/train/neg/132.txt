i bring an unaccustomed wine 
to lips long parching 
next to mine  
and summon them to drink crackling with fever  they 
essay  i turn my brimming eyes away  
and come next hour to look 
the hands still hug the tardy glass  
the lips i would have cooled  alas are so superfluous 
cold i would as soon attempt to warm 
the bosoms where the frost has lain 
ages beneath the mould some other thirsty there may be 
to whom this would have pointed me 
had it remained to speak and so i always bear the cup 
if  haply  mine may be the drop 
some pilgrim thirst to slake if  haply  any say to me  
unto the little  unto me   
when i at last awake
