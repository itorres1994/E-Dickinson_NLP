601

a still  
volcano  
life  
that flickered in the night  
when it was dark enough to do 
without erasing sight a quiet  
earthquake 
style  
too subtle to suspect 
by natures this side 
naples  
the 
north cannot detect
the 
solemn  
torrid  
symbol  
the lips that never lie  
whose hissing 
corals part  and shut  
and 
cities  ooze away
