i dreaded that first 
robin  so  
but 
he is mastered  now  
i'm accustomed to 
him grown  
he hurts a little  though i thought 
if i could only live 
till that first 
shout got by  
not all 
pianos in the 
woods 
had power to mangle me i dared not meet the 
daffodils  
for fear their 
yellow 
gown 
would pierce me with a fashion 
so foreign to my own i wished the 
grass would hurry  
so  when 'twas time to see  
he'd be too tall  the tallest one 
could stretch  to look at me i could not bear the 
bees should come  i wished they'd stay away 
in those dim countries where they go  
what word had they  for me 
they're here  though  not a creature failed  
no 
blossom stayed away 
in gentle deference to me  
the 
queen of 
calvary each one salutes me  as he goes  
and 
i  my childish 
plumes  
lift  in bereaved acknowledgment 
of their unthinking 
drums
