if anybody's friend be dead 
it's sharpest of the theme 
the thinking how they walked alive at such and such a time their costume  of a 
sunday  
some manner of the 
hair  
a prank nobody knew but them 
lost  in the 
sepulchre how warm  they were  on such a day  
you almost feel the date  
so short way off it seems  
and now  they're 
centuries from that how pleased they were  at what you said  
you try to touch the smile 
and dip your fingers in the frost  
when was it  
can you tell you asked the 
company to tea  
acquaintance  just a few  
and chatted close with this 
grand 
thing 
that don't remember you past 
bows  and 
invitations  
past 
interview  and 
vow  
past what 
ourself can estimate  
that  makes the 
quick of woe
