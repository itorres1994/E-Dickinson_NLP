i could die  to know  '
tis a trifling knowledge  
newsboys salute the 
door  
carts  joggle by  
morning's bold face  stares in the window  
were but mine  the 
charter of the least 
fly houses hunch the 
house 
with their 
brick 
shoulders  
coals  from a 
rolling 
load  rattle  how  near  
to the very 
square  
his foot is passing  
possibly  this moment  
while i  dream  
here
