35

nobody knows this little 
rose  
it might a pilgrim be 
did i not take it from the ways 
and lift it up to thee  
only a 
bee will miss it  
only a 
butterfly  
hastening from far journey  
on its breast to lie  
only a 
bird will wonder  
only a 
breeze will sigh  
ah 
little 
rose  how easy 
for such as thee to die
