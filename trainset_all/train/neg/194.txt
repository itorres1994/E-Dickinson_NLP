on this long storm the 
rainbow rose  
on this late 
morn  the 
sun  
the clouds  like listless 
elephants horizons  straggled down the 
birds rose smiling  in their nests  
the gales  indeed  were done  
alas  how heedless were the eyes  
on whom the summer shone 
the quiet nonchalance of death  
no 
daybreak  can bestir  
the slow  
archangel's syllables 
must awaken her
