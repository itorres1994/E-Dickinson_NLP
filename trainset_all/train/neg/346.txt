not probable  
the barest 
chance  
a smile too few  a word too much 
and far from 
heaven as the 
rest  
the 
soul so close on 
paradise what if the 
bird from journey far  
confused by 
sweets  as 
mortals  are  
forget the secret of 
his wing 
and perish  but a 
bough between  
oh  
groping feet  
oh 
phantom queen
