what 
soft  
cherubic 
creatures  
these 
gentlewomen are  
one would as soon assault a 
plush  
or violate a 
star such 
dimity 
convictions  
a 
horror so refined 
of freckled 
human 
nature  
of 
deity  ashamed it's such a common  
glory  
a 
fisherman's  
degree  
redemption  
brittle 
lady  
be so  ashamed of 
thee
