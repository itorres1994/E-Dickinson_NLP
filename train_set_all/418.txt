not in this 
world to see his face sounds long  until i read the place 
where this  is said to be 
but just the 
primer  to a life  
unopened  rare  
upon the 
shelf  
clasped yet  to 
him  and 
me and yet  
my 
primer suits me so i would not choose  a 
book to know 
than that  be sweeter wise  
might some one else  so learned  be  
and leave me  just my 
a  
b  
c himself  could have the 
skies
