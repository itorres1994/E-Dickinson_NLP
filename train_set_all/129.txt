cocoon above  
cocoon below  
stealthy 
cocoon  why hide you so 
what all the world suspect  
an hour  and gay on every tree 
your secret  perched in ecstasy 
defies imprisonment 
an hour in 
chrysalis to pass  
then gay above receding grass 
a 
butterfly to go  
a moment to interrogate  
then wiser than a  
surrogate   
the 
universe to know
