precious to 
me  
she still shall be though 
she forget the name i bear  
the fashion of the 
gown i wear  
the very 
color of 
my 
hair so like the 
meadows  now  i dared to show a 
tress of 
theirs 
if haply  
she might not despise 
a 
buttercup's 
array i know the 
whole  obscures the 
part  
the fraction  that appeased the 
heart 
till 
number's 
empery  
remembered  as the 
millner's flower
when 
summer's 
everlasting 
dower  
confronts the dazzled 
bee
