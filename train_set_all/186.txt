what shall i do  it whimpers so  
this little 
hound within the 
heart 
all day and night with bark and start  
and yet  it will not go  
would you untie it  were you me  
would it stop whining  if to 
thee i sent it  even now 
it should not tease you  
by your chair  or  on the mat  
or if it dare  to climb your dizzy knee  
or  sometimes at your side to run when you were willing  
shall it come  
tell 
carlo  
he'll tell me
