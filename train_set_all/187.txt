how many times these low feet staggered  
only the soldered mouth can tell  
try  can you stir the awful rivet  
try  can you lift the hasps of steel 
stroke the cool forehead  hot so often  
lift  if you care  the listless hair handle the adamantine fingers 
never a thimble  more  shall wear buzz the dull flies  on the chamber window  
brave  shines the sun through the freckled pane  
fearless  the cobweb swings from the ceiling indolent 
housewife  in 
daisies  lain
