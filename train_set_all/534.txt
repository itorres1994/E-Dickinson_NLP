we see  
comparatively  
the 
thing so towering high 
we could not grasp its segment 
unaided  
yesterday this 
morning's finer 
verdict  
makes scarcely worth the toil  
a furrow  
our 
cordillera  
our 
apennine  a 
knoll perhaps 'tis kindly  done us  
the 
anguish  and the loss  
the wrenching  for 
his 
firmament 
the 
thing belonged to us to spare these 
striding 
spirits 
some 
morning of 
chagrin  
the waking in a 
gnat's  embrace  
our 
giants  further on
