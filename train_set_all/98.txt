one dignity delays for all  
one mitred 
afternoon  
none can avoid this purple  
none evade this crown 
coach  it insures  and footmen  
chamber  and state  and throng  
bells  also  in the village 
as we ride grand along 
what dignified 
attendants  
what service when we pause  
how loyally at parting 
their hundred hats they raise 
her pomp surpassing ermine 
when simple 
you  and 
i  
present our meek escutcheon 
and claim the rank to die
