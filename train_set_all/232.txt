the 
sun  just touched the 
morning  
the 
morning  
happy thing  
supposed that 
he had come to dwell  
and 
life would all be spring 
she felt herself supremer  
a 
raised  
ethereal 
thing  
henceforth  for 
her  
what 
holiday  
meanwhile  
her wheeling 
king  
trailed  slow  along the 
orchards  
his haughty  spangled 
hems  
leaving a new necessity  
the want of diadems 
the 
morning  fluttered  staggered  
felt feebly  for 
her 
crown  
her unanointed forehead  
henceforth  
her only one
