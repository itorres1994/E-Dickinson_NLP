to hear an 
oriole sing 
may be a common thing  
or only a divine 
it is not of the 
bird 
who sings the same  unheard  
as unto 
crowd the 
fashion of the 
ear 
attireth that it hear 
in 
dun  or fair so whether it be 
rune  
or whether it be none 
is of within 
the  
tune is in the 
tree   
the 
skeptic  showeth me   
no 
sir  
in 
thee
