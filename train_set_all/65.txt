65

i can't tell you  but you feel it  
nor can you tell me  
saints  with ravished slate and pencil 
solve our 
april day 
sweeter than a vanished frolic 
from a vanished green  
swifter than the hoofs of 
horsemen 
round a 
ledge of dream 
modest  let us walk among it 
with our faces veiled  
as they say polite 
archangels 
do in meeting god 
not for me  to prate about it  
not for you  to say 
to some fashionable 
lady  
charming 
april day  
rather  
heaven's  
peter 
parley   
by which 
children slow 
to sublimer 
recitation 
are prepared to go
