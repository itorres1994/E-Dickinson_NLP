as far from pity  as complaint  
as cool to speech  as stone  
as numb to 
revelation 
as if my 
trade were 
bone as far from time  as 
history  
as near yourself  
today  
as 
children  to the 
rainbow's scarf or 
sunset's 
yellow play
to eyelids in the 
sepulchre  
how dumb the 
dancer lies  
while 
color's 
revelations break  
and blaze  the butterflies
