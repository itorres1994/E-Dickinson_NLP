the 
sun kept setting  setting  still 
no 
hue of 
afternoon  
upon the 
village i perceived 
from 
house to 
house 'twas 
noon the 
dusk kept dropping  dropping  still 
no 
dew upon the 
grass  
but only on my 
forehead stopped and wandered in my 
face my 
feet kept drowsing  drowsing  still 
my fingers were awake  
yet why so little sound  
myself 
unto my 
seeming  make 
how well i knew the 
light before  i could see it now  '
tis 
dying  i am doing  but 
i'm not afraid to know
