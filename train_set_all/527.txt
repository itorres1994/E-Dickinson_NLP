to put this 
world down  like a 
bundle  
and walk steady  away  
requires 
energy  possibly 
agony  '
tis the 
scarlet way
trodden with straight renunciation 
by the 
son of 
god  
later  his faint 
confederates 
justify the 
road flavors of that old 
crucifixion  
filaments of 
bloom  
pontius 
pilate sowed  
strong 
clusters  from 
barabbas' 
tomb sacrament  
saints partook before us  
patent  every drop  
with the 
brand of the 
gentile 
drinker 
who indorsed the 
cup
