do 
people moulder equally  
they bury  in the 
grave  i do believe a 
species 
as positively live
as 
i  who testify it 
deny that i  am dead  
and fill my 
lungs  for 
witness  
from 
tanks  above my 
head i say to you  said 
jesus  
that there be standing here  
a 
sort  that shall not taste of 
death  
if 
jesus was sincere i need no further 
argue  
that statement of the 
lord 
is not a controvertible  
he told me  
death was dead
