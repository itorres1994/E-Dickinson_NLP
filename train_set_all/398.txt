i had not minded  
walls  
were 
universe  one 
rock  
and fr i heard his silver 
call 
the other side the 
block i'd tunnel  till my 
groove 
pushed sudden thro' to his  
then my face take her 
recompense  
the looking in his 
eyes but 'tis a single 
hair  
a filament  a law  
a 
cobweb  wove in 
adamant  
a 
battlement  of 
straw a limit like the 
veil 
unto the 
lady's face  
but every 
mesh  a 
citadel  
and 
dragons  in the 
crease
