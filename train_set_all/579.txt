i had been hungry  all the 
years  
my 
noon had 
come  to dine  i trembling drew the 
table near  
and touched the 
curious 
wine '
twas this on 
tables i had seen  
when turning  hungry  
home i looked in 
windows  for the 
wealth i could not hope  for 
mine i did not know the ample 
bread  '
twas so unlike the 
crumb 
the 
birds and 
i  had often shared 
in 
nature's  
dining 
room the 
plenty hurt me  'twas so new  
myself felt ill  and odd  
as 
berry  of a 
mountain 
bush  
transplanted  to a 
road nor was i hungry  so i found 
that 
hunger  was a way 
of 
persons outside 
windows  
the 
entering  takes away
