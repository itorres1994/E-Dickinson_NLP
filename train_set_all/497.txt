he strained my faith  
did he find it supple  
shook my strong trust did it then  yield 
hurled my belief  
but  did he shatter  it  
racked  with suspense  
not a nerve failed 
wrung me  with 
anguish  
but i never doubted him  '
tho' for what wrong 
he did never say stabbed  while i sued 
his sweet forgiveness  
jesus  it's your little  
john   
don't you know  me
