8

there is a word 
which bears a sword 
can pierce an armed man  
it hurls its barbed syllables 
and is mute again  
but where it fell 
the saved will tell 
on patriotic day  
some epauletted 
brother 
gave his breath away 
wherever runs the breathless sun  
wherever roams the day  
there is its noiseless onset  
there is its victory  
behold the keenest marksman  
the most accomplished shot  
time's sublimest target 
is a soul  forgot
