the 
black 
berry  wears a 
thorn in his side  
but no 
man heard 
him cry  
he offers 
his 
berry  just the same 
to 
partridge  and to 
boy he sometimes holds upon the 
fence  
or struggles to a 
tree  
or clasps a 
rock  with both 
his 
hands  
but not for 
sympathy we  tell a 
hurt  to cool it  
this 
mourner  to the 
sky 
a little further reaches  instead  
brave 
black 
berry
