what is   
paradise   
who live there  
are they  
farmers   
do they  hoe   
do they know that this is  
amherst   
and that i  am coming  too do they wear  new shoes   in  
eden   
is it always pleasant  there  
won't they scold us  when we're homesick  
or tell 
god  how cross we are you are sure there's such a person 
as  a 
father   in the sky  
so if i get lost  there  ever  
or do what the 
nurse calls  die   i shan't walk the  
jasper   barefoot  
ransomed folks  won't laugh at me  
maybe   
eden  a'n't so lonesome 
as 
new 
england used to be
