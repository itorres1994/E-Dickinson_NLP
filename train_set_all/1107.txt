1107

the 
bird did prance  the 
bee did play  
the 
sun ran miles away 
so blind with joy he could not choose 
between his holiday
the morn was up  the meadows out 
the 
fences all but ran  
republic of 
delight  i thought 
where each is 
citizen from 
heavy laden 
lands to thee 
were seas to cross to come 
a 
caspian were crowded  
too near thou art for 
fame
