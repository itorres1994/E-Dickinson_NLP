277

what if i say i shall not wait  
what if i burst the fleshly 
gate  
and pass escaped  to thee 
what if i file this 
mortal  off  
see where it hurt me  
that's enough  
and wade in liberty 
they cannot take me  any more  
dungeons can call  and 
guns implore 
unmeaning  now  to me as laughter  was  an hour ago  
or 
laces  or a 
travelling 
show  
or who died  yesterday
