the face i carry with me  last  
when i go out of 
time  
to take my 
rank  by  in the 
west  
that face  will just be thine i'll hand it to the 
angel  
that  
sir  was my 
degree  
in 
kingdoms  you have heard the 
raised  
refer to  possibly 
he'll take it  scan it  step aside  
return  with such a crown 
as 
gabriel  never capered at  
and beg me put it on and then  he'll turn me round and round  
to an admiring sky  
as one that bore her 
master's name  
sufficient royalty
