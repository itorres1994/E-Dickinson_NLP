the 
loneliness 
one dare not sound  
and would as soon surmise 
as in its 
grave go plumbing 
to ascertain the size the 
loneliness whose worst alarm 
is lest itself should see  
and perish from before itself 
for just a scrutiny the 
horror not to be surveyed  
but skirted in the 
dark  
with 
consciousness suspended  
and 
being under 
lock i fear me this  is 
loneliness  
the 
maker of the soul 
its 
caverns and its 
corridors 
illuminate  or seal
