my period had come for 
prayer  
no other 
art  would do  
my 
tactics missed a rudiment  
creator  
was it you 
god grows above  so those who pray 
horizons  must ascend  
and so i stepped upon the 
north 
to see this 
curious 
friend his 
house was not  no sign had 
he  
by 
chimney  nor by 
door 
could i infer his 
residence  
vast 
prairies of air
unbroken by a 
settler  
were all that i could see  
infinitude  
had'st 
thou no 
face 
that i might look on thee 
the 
silence condescended  
creation stopped  for 
me  
but awed beyond my errand  i worshipped  did not  pray
