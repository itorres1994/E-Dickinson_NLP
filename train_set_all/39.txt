it did not surprise me  
so i said  or thought  
she will stir her pinions 
and the nest forgot 
traverse broader forests  
build in gayer boughs  
breathe in 
ear more modern 
god's old fashioned vows this was but a 
birdling what and if it be 
one within my bosom 
had departed me 
this was but a story  
what and if indeed 
there were just such coffin 
in the heart instead
