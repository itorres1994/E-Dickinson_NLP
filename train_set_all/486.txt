486

i was the slightest in the 
house  i took the smallest 
room  
at night  my little 
lamp  and 
book  
and one 
geranium so stationed i could catch the 
mint 
that never ceased to fall  
and just my 
basket  
let me think  
i'm sure  
that this was all i never spoke  unless addressed and then  'twas brief and low  i could not bear to live  aloud  
the 
racket shamed me so and if it had not been so far  
and any one i knew 
were going  i had often thought 
how noteless  i could die
