taking up the fair 
ideal  
just to cast her down 
when a fracture  we discover  
or a splintered 
crown  
makes the 
heavens portable  
and the 
gods  a lie  
doubtless   
adam   scowled at 
eden  
for his perjury 
cherishing  our pool 
ideal  
till in purer dress  
we behold her  glorified  
comforts  search  like this  
till the broken creatures  
we adored  for whole  
stains  all washed  
transfigured  mended  
meet us  with a smile
