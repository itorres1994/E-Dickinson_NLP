 hope  is the thing with feathers  
that perches in the soul  
and sings the tune without the words  
and never stops  at all and sweetest  in the 
gale  is heard  
and sore must be the storm  
that could abash the little 
bird 
that kept so many warm i've heard it in the chillest land  
and on the strangest 
sea  
yet  never  in 
extremity  
it asked a crumb  of me
