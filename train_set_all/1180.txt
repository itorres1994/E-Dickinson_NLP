 remember me  implored the 
thief  
oh 
hospitality  
my 
guest  
today in 
paradise  i give thee guaranty 
that 
courtesy will fair remain 
when the 
delight is 
dust 
with which we cite this mightiest case 
of compensated trust 
of all we are allowed to hope 
but 
affidavit stands 
that this was due where most we fear 
be unexpected friends
