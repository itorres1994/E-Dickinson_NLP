i can wade 
grief  
whole 
pools of it  
i'm used to that  
but the least push of 
joy 
breaks up my feet  
and i tip  drunken  
let no 
pebble  smile '
twas the 
new 
liquor  
that was all 
power is only 
pain  
stranded  thro' 
discipline  
till 
weights  will hang give 
balm  to 
giants  
and they'll wilt  like 
men  
give 
himmaleh  
they'll 
carry  him
