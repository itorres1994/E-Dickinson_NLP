a shady friend  for 
torrid days  
is easier to find  
than one of higher temperature 
for 
frigid  hour of 
mind the 
vane a little to the 
east  
scares 
muslin souls  away  
if 
broadcloth 
hearts are firmer  
than those of 
organdy who is to blame  
the 
weaver  
ah  the bewildering thread  
the 
tapestries of 
paradise 
so notelessly  are made
