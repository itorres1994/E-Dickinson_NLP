there is another sky  
ever serene and fair  
and there is another sunshine  
though it be darkness there  
never mind faded forests  
austin  
never mind silent fields  
here is a little forest  
whose leaf is ever green  
here is a brighter garden  
where not a frost has been  
in its unfading flowers i hear the bright bee hum  
prithee  my brother  
into my garden come
