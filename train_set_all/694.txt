the 
heaven vests for 
each 
in that small 
deity 
it craved the grace to worship 
some bashful 
summer's 
day half shrinking from the 
glory 
it importuned to see 
till these faint 
tabernacles drop 
in full 
eternity how imminent the 
venture  
as one should sue a 
star  
for 
his mean sake to leave the 
row 
and entertain 
despair a 
clemency so common  
we almost cease to fear  
enabling the minutest  
and furthest  to adore
