it would have starved a 
gnat  
to live so small as i  
and yet i was a living 
child  
with 
food's necessity
upon me  like a 
claw  i could no more remove 
than i could coax a 
leech away  
or make a 
dragon  move not like the 
gnat  had i  
the privilege to fly 
and seek a 
dinner for myself  
how mightier 
he  than i nor like 
himself  the 
art 
upon the 
window 
pane 
to gad my little 
being out  
and not begin  again
