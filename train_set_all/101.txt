will there really be a  
morning   
is there such a thing as  
day   
could i see it from the mountains 
if i were as tall as they 
has it feet like 
water lilies  
has it feathers like a 
bird  
is it brought from famous countries 
of which i have never heard 
oh some 
scholar  
oh some 
sailor  
oh some 
wise 
men from the skies  
please to tell a little 
pilgrim 
where the place called  
morning  lies
