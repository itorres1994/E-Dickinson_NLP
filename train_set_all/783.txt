the 
birds begun at 
four o'clock  
their period for 
dawn  
a 
music numerous as space  
but neighboring as 
noon i could not count their 
force  
their 
voices did expend 
as 
brook by 
brook bestows itself 
to multiply the pond 
their 
witnesses were not  
except occasional man  
in homely industry arrayed  
to overtake the 
morn nor was it for applause that i could ascertain but independent 
ecstasy 
of 
deity and 
men by 
six  the 
flood had done  
no 
tumult there had been 
of 
dressing  or 
departure  
and yet the 
band was gone the 
sun engrossed the 
east  
the 
day controlled the 
world  
the 
miracle that introduced 
forgotten  as fulfilled
