you're right   the way is narrow   
and  difficult the 
gate   
and  few there be   
correct again  
that  enter in  thereat  '
tis 
costly  
so are purples  '
tis just the price of 
breath  
with but the  
discount  of the 
grave  
termed by the 
brokers   
death   and after that  there's 
heaven  
the 
good 
man's   
dividend   
and 
bad 
men   go to 
jail   i guess
