there's a certain 
slant of light  
winter 
afternoons  
that oppresses  like the 
heft 
of 
cathedral 
tunes heavenly 
hurt  it gives us  
we can find no scar  
but internal difference  
where the 
meanings  are none may teach it  
any  '
tis the 
seal 
despair  
an imperial affliction 
sent us of the 
air when it comes  the 
landscape listens  
shadows  hold their breath  
when it goes  'tis like the 
distance 
on the look of 
death
