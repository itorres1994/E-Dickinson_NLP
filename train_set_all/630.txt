the 
lightning playeth  all the while  
but when 
he singeth  then  
ourselves are conscious 
he exist  
and we approach 
him  stern with 
insulators  and a 
glove  
whose short  sepulchral 
bass 
alarms us  tho' 
his 
yellow feet 
may pass  and counterpass upon the 
ropes  above our 
head  
continual  with the 
news  
nor 
we so much as check our speech  
nor stop to cross 
ourselves
