the 
sun and 
moon must make their haste  
the 
stars express around 
for in the 
zones of 
paradise 
the 
lord alone is burned his 
eye  it is the 
east and 
west  
the 
north and 
south when 
he 
do concentrate 
his 
countenance 
like 
glow 
worms  flee away oh 
poor and 
far  
oh 
hindred 
eye 
that hunted for the 
day  
the 
lord a 
candle entertains 
entirely for 
thee
