i got so i could take his name  
without  
tremendous gain  
that 
stopsensation  on my 
soul  
and 
thunder  in the 
room i got so i could walk across 
that 
angle in the floor  
where he turned so  and i turned  how  
and all our 
sinew tore i got so i could stir the 
box  
in which his letters grew 
without that forcing  in my breath  
as 
staples  driven through could dimly recollect a 
grace  i think  they call it  
god   
renowned to ease 
extremity  
when 
formula  had failed and shape my 
hands  
petition's way  
tho' ignorant of a word 
that 
ordination  utters my 
business  with the 
cloud  
if any 
power behind it  be  
not subject to 
despair  
it care  in some remoter way  
for so minute affair 
as 
misery  
itself  too vast  for interrupting  more
