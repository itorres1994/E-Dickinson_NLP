1202

the 
frost was never seen  
if met  too rapid passed  
or in too unsubstantial 
team  
the 
flowers notice first
a 
stranger hovering round 
a 
symptom of alarm 
in 
villages remotely set 
but search effaces him
till some retrieveless 
night 
our 
vigilance at waste 
the 
garden gets the only shot 
that never could be traced 
unproved is much we know  
unknown the worst we fear  
of 
strangers is the 
earth the 
inn 
of 
secrets is the 
air to analyze perhaps 
a 
philip would prefer 
but 
labor vaster than myself i find it to infer
