78

a poor  torn heart  a tattered heart  
that sat it down to rest  
nor noticed that the 
ebbing 
day 
flowed silver to the 
west  
nor noticed 
night did soft descend nor 
constellation burn  
intent upon the vision 
of latitudes unknown 
the angels  happening that way 
this dusty heart espied  
tenderly took it up from toil 
and carried it to 
god  
there  sandals for the 
barefoot  
there  gathered from the gales  
do the blue havens by the hand 
lead the wandering sails
