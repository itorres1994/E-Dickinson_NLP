we do not play on 
graves  
because there isn't 
room  
besides  it isn't even  it slants 
and 
people come and put a 
flower on it  
and hang their faces so  
we're fearing that their 
hearts will drop  
and crush our pretty play and so we move as far 
as 
enemies  away  
just looking round to see how far 
it is  
occasionally
