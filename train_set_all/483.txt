a 
solemn thing within the 
soul 
to feel itself get ripe  
and golden hang  while farther up  
the 
maker's 
ladders stop  
and in the 
orchard far below  
you hear a 
being  drop a 
wonderful  to feel the 
sun 
still toiling at the 
cheek 
you thought was finished  
cool of eye  and critical of 
work  
he shifts the stem  a little  
to give your 
core  a look but solemnest  to know 
your chance in 
harvest moves 
a little nearer  
every 
sun 
the 
single  to some lives
