her sweet 
weight on my 
heart a 
night 
had scarcely deigned to lie  
when  stirring  for 
belief's delight  
my 
bride had slipped away if 'twas a 
dream  made solid  just 
the 
heaven to confirm  
or if 
myself were dreamed of 
her

him remain  who unto 
me  
gave  even as to 
all  
a 
fiction superseding 
faith  
by so much  as 'twas real
