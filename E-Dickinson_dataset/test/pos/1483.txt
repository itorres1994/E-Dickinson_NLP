the 
robin is a 
gabriel 
in humble circumstances  
his 
dress denotes him socially 
of 
transport's 
working 
classes  
he has the punctuality 
of the 
new 
england 
farmer  
the same oblique integrity 
a 
vista vastly warmer a small but sturdy 
residence 
a self denying 
household 
the 
guests of 
perspicacity 
are all that cross his 
threshold  
as covert as a 
fugitive 
cajoling 
consternation 
by 
ditties to the 
enemy 
and 
sylvan
