the 
mushroom is the 
elf of 
plants at 
evening  it is not  
at 
morning  in a 
truffled 
hut 
it stop upon a spot
as if it tarried always 
and yet its whole 
career 
is shorter than a 
snake's 
delay 
and fleeter than a 
tare '
tis 
vegetation's 
juggler  
the 
germ of 
alibi  
doth like a 
bubble antedate 
and like a 
bubble  hie i feel as if the 
grass was pleased 
to have it intermit  
this surreptitious scion 
of 
summer's circumspect 
had 
nature any supple 
face 
or could she one contemn  
had 
nature an 
apostate  
that 
mushroom  it is him
