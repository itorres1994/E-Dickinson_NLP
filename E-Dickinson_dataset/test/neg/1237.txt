my 
heart ran so to thee 
it would not wait for me 
and i affronted grew 
and drew away
for whatsoe'er my pace 
he first achieve they 
face 
how general a 
grace 
allotted two not in malignity 
mentioned i this to thee had he obliquity 
soonest to share 
but for the 
greed of him  
boasting my 
premium  
basking in 
bethleem 
ere i be there
