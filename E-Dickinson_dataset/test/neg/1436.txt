than 
heaven more remote  
for 
heaven is the root  
but these the flitted seed  
more flown indeed 
than ones that never were  
or those that hide  and are 
what madness  by their side  
a vision to provide 
of future days 
they cannot praise 
my soul  to find them  come  
they cannot call  they're dumb  
nor prove  nor woo  
but that they have abode 
is absolute as 
god  
and instant  too
