rearrange a  
wife's  affection  
when they dislocate my 
brain  
amputate my freckled 
bosom  
make me bearded like a man 
blush  my spirit  in thy 
fastness  
blush  my unacknowledged clay  
seven years of troth have taught thee 
more than 
wifehood every may 
love that never leaped its socket  
trust entrenched in narrow pain  
constancy thro' fire  awarded  
anguish  bare of anodyne 
burden  borne so far triumphant  
none suspect me of the crown  
for i wear the  
thorns  till 
sunset then  my 
diadem put on 
big my 
secret but it's bandaged  
it will never get away 
till the 
day its 
weary 
keeper 
leads it through the 
grave to thee
