a single 
clover 
plank 
was all that saved a 
bee 
a 
bee i personally knew 
from sinking in the sky '
twixt 
firmament above
and 
firmament below 
the 
billows of 
circumference 
were sweeping him away the idly swaying 
plank 
responsible to nought 
a sudden 
freight of 
wind assumed 
and 
bumble 
bee was not this harrowing event 
transpiring in the 
grass 
did not so much as wring from him 
a wandering  
alas
