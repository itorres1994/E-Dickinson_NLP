through those old 
grounds of memory  
the sauntering alone 
is a divine intemperance 
a prudent man would shun  
of liquors that are vended '
tis easy to beware 
but statutes do not meddle 
with the internal bar  
pernicious as the sunset 
permitting to pursue 
but impotent to gather  
the tranquil perfidy 
alloys our firmer moments 
with that severest gold 
convenient to the longing 
but otherwise withheld
