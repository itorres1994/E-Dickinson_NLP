in many and reportless places 
we feel a 
joy  
reportless  also  but sincere as 
nature 
or 
deity it comes  without a consternation  
dissolves  the same  
but leaves a sumptuous 
destitution without a 
name profane it by a search  we cannot 
it has no home  
nor we who having once inhaled it thereafter roam
