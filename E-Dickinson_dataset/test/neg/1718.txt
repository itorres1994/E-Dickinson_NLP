1718

drowning is not so pitiful 
as the attempt to rise 
three times  'tis said  a sinking man 
comes up to face the skies  
and then declines forever 
to that abhorred abode  
where hope and he part company  
for he is grasped of 
god  
the 
maker's cordial visage  
however good to see  
is shunned  we must admit it  
like an adversity
