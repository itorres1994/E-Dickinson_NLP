so much of 
heaven has gone from 
earth 
that there must be a 
heaven 
if only to enclose the 
saints 
to 
affidavit given
the 
missionary to the 
mole 
must prove there is a 
sky 
location doubtless he would plead 
but what excuse have i
too much of 
proof affronts 
belief 
the 
turtle will not try 
unless you leave him  then return 
and he has hauled away
