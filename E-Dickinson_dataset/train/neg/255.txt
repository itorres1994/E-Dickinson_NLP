to die  takes just a little while  
they say it doesn't hurt  
it's only fainter  by degrees  
and then  it's out of sight a darker 
ribbon  for a 
day  
a 
crape upon the 
hat  
and then the pretty sunshine comes  
and helps us to forget the absent  mystic  creature  
that but for love of us  
had gone to sleep  that soundest time  
without the weariness
