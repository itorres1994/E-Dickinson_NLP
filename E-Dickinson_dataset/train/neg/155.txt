the 
murmur of a 
bee 
a 
witchcraft  yieldeth me  
if any ask me why  '
twere easier to die  
than tell the 
red upon the 
hill 
taketh away my will  
if anybody sneer  
take care  for 
god is here  
that's all
the 
breaking of the 
day 
addeth to my 
degree  
if any ask me how  
artist  who drew me so  
must tell
