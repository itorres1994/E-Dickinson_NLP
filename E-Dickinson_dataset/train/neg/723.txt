it tossed  and tossed  
a little 
brig i knew  o'ertook by 
blast  
it spun  and spun  
and groped delirious for 
morn it slipped  and slipped  
as 
one that drunken  stept  
its white foot tripped  
then dropped from sight ah 
brig  
good 
night 
to 
crew and 
you  
the 
ocean's 
heart too smooth  too 
blue  
to break for 
you
