the 
doomed  regard the 
sunrise 
with different 
delight  
because  when next it burns abroad 
they doubt to witness it the 
man  to die  tomorrow  
harks for the 
meadow 
bird  
because its 
music stirs the 
axe 
that clamors for his head joyful  to whom the 
sunrise 
precedes 
enamored  
day  
joyful  for whom the 
meadow 
bird 
has ought but elegy
