i've known a 
heaven  like a 
tent  
to wrap its shining 
yards  
pluck up its stakes  and disappear without the sound of 
boards 
or 
rip of 
nail  
or 
carpenter  
but just the miles of 
stare  
that signalize a 
show's 
retreat  
in 
north 
america no 
trace  no 
figment of the 
thing 
that dazzled  
yesterday  
no 
ring  no 
marvel  
men  and 
feats  
dissolved as utterly  
as 
bird's far 
navigation 
discloses just a 
hue  
a plash of 
oars  a 
gaiety  
then swallowed up  of view
