we don't cry  
tim and 
i 
we are far too grand  
but we bolt the door tight 
to prevent a friend then we hide our brave face 
deep in our hand  
not to cry  
tim and i  
we are far too grand nor to dream  he and me  
do we condescend  
we just shut our brown eye 
to see to the end tim  see 
cottages  
but 
oh so high 
then  we shake  
tim and i  
and lest i  cry tim  reads a little 
hymn  
and we both pray  
please 
sir i and 
tim  
always lost the way
we must die  by and by  
clergymen say  
tim  shall  if i  do i  too  if he how shall we arrange it  
tim  was  so  shy 
take us simultaneous  
lord  i  
tim  and me
