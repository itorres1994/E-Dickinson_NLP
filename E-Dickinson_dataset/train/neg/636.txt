636

the way i read a letter's   this  
'tis first   i lock the door  
and push it with my fingers   next  
for transport it be sure  

and then i go the furthest off
to counteract a knock  
then draw my little letter forth
and slowly pick the lock  

then   glancing narrow  at the wall  
and narrow at the floor
for firm conviction of a mouse
not exorcised before  

peruse how infinite i am
to no one that you   know  
and sigh for lack of heaven   but not
the heaven god bestow
