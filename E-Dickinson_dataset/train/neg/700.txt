700

you've seen 
balloons set  
haven't 
you 
so stately they ascend  
it is as 
swans  discarded 
you 
for 
duties 
diamond their 
liquid 
feet go softly out 
upon a 
sea of 
blonde  
they spurn the 
air as t'were too mean 
for 
creatures so renowned their 
ribbons just beyond the eye  
they struggle  some  for 
breath  
and yet the 
crowd applaud below  
they would not encore  
death the 
gilded 
creature strains  and spins  
trips frantic in a 
tree  
tears open her imperial 
veins  
and tumbles in the 
sea the 
crowd  retire with an 
oath  
the 
dust in 
streets  go down  
and 
clerks in 
counting 
rooms 
observe  '
twas only a 
balloon
