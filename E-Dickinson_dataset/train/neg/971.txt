robbed by 
death  but that was easy  
to the failing 
eye i could hold the latest 
glowing  
robbed by liberty
for 
her 
jugular 
defences  
this  too  i endured  
hint of 
glory  it afforded  
for the 
brave 
beloved fraud of 
distance  
fraud of 
danger  
fraud of 
death  to bear  
it is 
bounty  to 
suspense's 
vague 
calamity stalking our entire 
possession 
on a 
hair's result  
then  seesawing  coolly  on it  
trying if it split
