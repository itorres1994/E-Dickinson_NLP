50

i haven't told my garden yet  
lest that should conquer me i haven't quite the strength now 
to break it to the 
bee i will not name it in the street 
for shops would stare at me  
that one so shy  so ignorant 
should have the face to die
the hillsides must not know it  
where i have rambled so  
nor tell the loving forests 
the day that i shall go nor lisp it at the table nor heedless by the way 
hint that within the 
riddle 
one will walk today
