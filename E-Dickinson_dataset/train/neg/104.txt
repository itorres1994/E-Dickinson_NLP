104

where i have lost i softer tread  i sow sweet flower from garden bed  i pause above that vanished head 
and mourn
whom i have lost i pious guard 
from accent harsh or ruthless word  
feeling as if their pillow heard 
though stone
when i have lost you'll know by this  
a 
bonnet black  
a dusk surplice a little tremor in my voice 
like this
why i have lost the people know 
who dressed in flocks of purest snow 
went home a century ago 
next bliss
