one 
anguish  in a 
crowd  
a 
minor thing  it sounds  
and yet unto the single 
doe 
attempted of the hounds'
tis 
terror as consummate 
as 
legions of 
alarm 
did leap full flanked upon the 
host  '
tis 
units  make the 
swarm a 
small 
leech  on the 
vitals  
the sliver in the 
lung  
the 
bung out  of an 
artery  
are scarce accounted  
harms yet might  by relation 
to that 
repealless thing  
a 
being  impotent to end  
when once it has begun
