sweet  
you forgot  but i remembered 
every time  for 
two  
so that the 
sum be never hindered 
through 
decay of 
you say if i erred  
accuse my 
farthings  
blame the little 
hand 
happy it be for 
you  a 
beggar's  
seeking 
more  to spend just to be 
rich  to waste my 
guineas 
on so 
best a 
heart  
just to be 
poor  for 
barefoot 
vision 
you  
sweet  
shut me out
