1123

a great 
hope fell 
you heard no noise 
the 
ruin was within 
oh cunning wreck that told no tale 
and let no 
witness in
the mind was built for mighty 
freight 
for dread occasion planned 
how often foundering at 
sea 
ostensibly on land
a not admitting of the wound 
until it grew so wide 
that all my 
life had entered it 
and there were troughs beside
a closing of the simple lid 
that opened to the sun 
until the tender 
carpenter 
perpetual nail it down
