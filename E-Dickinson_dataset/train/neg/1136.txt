the 
frost of 
death was on the 
pane   
secure your 
flower  said he  
like 
sailors fighting with a 
leak 
we fought mortality 
our passive 
flower we held to 
sea  
to 
mountain  
to the 
sun  
yet even on his 
scarlet shelf 
to crawl the 
frost begun we pried him back 
ourselves we wedged 
himself and her between  
yet easy as the narrow 
snake 
he forked his way along
till all her helpless beauty bent 
and then our wrath begun  
we hunted him to his 
ravine 
we chased him to his 
den we hated 
death and hated 
life 
and nowhere was to go  
than 
sea and continent there is 
a larger  it is 
woe
