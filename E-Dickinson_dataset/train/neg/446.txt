i showed her 
heights she never saw   
would'st 
climb   i said  
she said   
not so    
with me   i said  
with me  i showed her 
secrets  
morning's 
nest  
the 
rope the 
nights were put across  
and now   
would'st have me for a 
guest   
she could not find her 
yes  
and then  i brake my life  
and 
lo  
a 
light  for her  did solemn glow  
the larger  as her face withdrew  
and could she  further   no
