i think just how my shape will rise when i shall be  forgiven   
till 
hair  and 
eyes  and timid 
head  
are out of sight  in 
heaven i think just how my lips will weigh  
with shapeless  quivering  prayer  
that you  so late   
consider  me  
the  
sparrow  of your 
care i mind me that of 
anguish  sent  
some drifts were moved away  
before my simple bosom  broke  
and why not this  if they 
and so i con that thing   forgiven   
until  delirious  borne  
by my long bright  and longer  trust  i drop my 
heart  unshriven
