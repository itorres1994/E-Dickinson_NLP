like eyes that looked on 
wastes  
incredulous of 
ought 
but 
blank  and steady 
wilderness diversified by 
night just 
infinites of 
nought  
as far as it could see  
so looked the face i looked upon  
so looked itself  on 
me i offered it no 
help  
because the 
cause was 
mine  
the 
misery a 
compact 
as hopeless  as divine neither  would be absolved  
neither would be a 
queen 
without the 
other  
therefore  
we perish  tho' 
we reign
