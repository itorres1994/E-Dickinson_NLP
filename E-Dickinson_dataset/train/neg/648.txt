promise 
this  
when 
you be 
dying  
some shall summon 
me  
mine belong 
your latest 
sighing  
mine  to 
belt 
your 
eye not with 
coins  though they be 
minted 
from an 
emperor's 
hand  
be my lips  the only 
buckle 
your low 
eyes  demand mine to stay  when all have wandered  
to devise once more 
if the 
life be too surrendered  
life of 
mine  restore poured like this  
my 
whole 
libation  
just that 
you should see 
bliss of 
death  
life's 
bliss extol thro' 
imitating 
you mine  to guard 
your 
narrow 
precinct  
to seduce the 
sun 
longest on 
your 
south  to linger  
largest 
dews of morn
to demand  in 
your low favor 
lest the 
jealous 
grass 
greener lean  
or fonder cluster 
round some other face mine to supplicate 
madonna  
if 
madonna be 
could behold so far a 
creature  
christ  omitted  
me just to follow 
your dear future  
ne'er so far behind  
for 
my 
heaven  
had i not been 
most enough  denied
