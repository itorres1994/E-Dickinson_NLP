you see i cannot see  your lifetime  i must guess  
how many times it ache for me  today  
confess  
how many times for my far sake 
the brave eyes film  
but i guess guessing hurts  
mine  got so dim 
too vague  the face  
my own  so patient  covers  
too far  the strength  
my timidness enfolds  
haunting the 
heart  
like her translated faces  
teasing the want  
it  only  can suffice
