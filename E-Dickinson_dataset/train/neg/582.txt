inconceivably solemn  
things go gay 
pierce  by the very 
press 
of 
imagery their far 
parades  order on the eye 
with a mute 
pomp  
a pleading 
pageantry flags  are a brave sight  
but no true 
eye 
ever went by 
one  
steadily music's triumphant  
but the fine 
ear 
winces with delight 
are 
drums too near
