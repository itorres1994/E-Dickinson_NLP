distrustful of the 
gentian  
and just to turn away 
the fluttering of her fringes 
child my perfidy  
weary for my  i will singing go  i shall not feel the sleet  then  i shall not fear the snow
flees so the phantom meadow 
before the breathless 
bee  
so bubble brooks in deserts 
on 
ears that dying lie  
burn so the 
evening 
spires 
to 
eyes that 
closing go  
hangs so distant 
heaven  
to a hand below
