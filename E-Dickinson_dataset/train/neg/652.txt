a 
prison gets to be a friend  
between its 
ponderous face 
and 
ours  a 
kinsmanship express  
and in its narrow 
eyes we come to look with gratitude 
for the appointed 
beam 
it deal us  stated as our food  
and hungered for  the same  
we learn to know the 
planks  
that answer to 
our feet  
so miserable a sound  at first  
nor ever now  so sweet as plashing in the 
pools  
when 
memory was a 
boy  
but a 
demurer 
circuit a 
geometric 
joy the 
posture of the 
key 
that interrupt the 
day 
to 
our 
endeavor  
not so real 
the 
check of 
liberty as this 
phantasm 
steel  
whose features  
day and 
night  
are present to us  as 
our 
own  
and as escapeless  quite the narrow 
round  the 
stint  
the slow exchange of 
hope  
for something passiver  
content 
too steep for looking up the 
liberty we knew 
avoided  like a 
dream  
too wide for any 
night but 
heaven  
if 
that  indeed  redeem
