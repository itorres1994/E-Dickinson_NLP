except to 
heaven  she is nought  
except for 
angels  lone  
except to some widewandering 
bee 
a flower superfluous blown 
except for winds  provincial  
except by 
butterflies 
unnoticed as a single dew 
that on the 
acre lies 
the smallest 
housewife in the grass  
yet take her from the 
lawn 
and somebody has lost the face 
that made 
existence  home
