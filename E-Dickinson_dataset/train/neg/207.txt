207

tho' i get home how late  how late  
so i get home  'twill compensate  
better will be the 
ecstasy 
that they have done expecting me  
when 
night  descending  dumb  and dark they hear my unexpected knock  
transporting must the moment be  
brewed from decades of agony 
to think just how the fire will burn just how longcheated eyes will turn  
to wonder what myself will say  
and what itself  will say to me  
beguiles the 
centuries of way
