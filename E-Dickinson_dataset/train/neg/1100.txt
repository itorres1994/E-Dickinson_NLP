1100

the last 
night that 
she lived 
it was a 
common 
night 
except the 
dying  this to 
us 
made 
nature different
we noticed smallest things  
things overlooked before 
by this great light upon our 
minds 
italicized  as 'twere
as 
we went out and in 
between 
her final 
room 
and 
rooms where 
those to be alive 
tomorrow were a blame
that 
others could exist 
while 
she must finish quite 
a 
jealousy for 
her arose 
so nearly infinite we waited while 
she passed  
it was a narrow time  
too jostled were 
our 
souls to speak 
at length the notice came
she mentioned and forgot  
then lightly as a 
reed 
bent to the 
water struggled scarce  
consented and was dead and 
we  
we placed the 
hair  
and drew the 
head erect  
and then an awful leisure was 
belief to regulate
