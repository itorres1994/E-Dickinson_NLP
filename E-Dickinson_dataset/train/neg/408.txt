unit  like 
death  for 
whom  
true  like the 
tomb  
who tells no secret 
told to 
him  
the 
grave is strict  
tickets admit 
just two  the 
bearer  
and the 
borne  
and seat  just 
one  
the 
living  tell  
the 
dying  but a 
syllable  
the 
coy 
dead  
none  
no 
chatter  here  no tea  
so 
babbler  and 
bohea  stay there  
but 
gravity  and 
expectation  and 
fear  
a tremor just  that 
all's not sure
