i never felt at 
home  
below  
and in the 
handsome 
skies i shall not feel at 
home  i know  i don't like 
paradise because it's 
sunday  all the time  
and 
recess  never comes  
and 
eden'll be so lonesome 
bright 
wednesday 
afternoons if 
god could make a visit  
or ever took a 
nap  
so not to see us  but they say 
himself  a telescope
perennial beholds us  
myself would run away 
from 
him  and 
holy 
ghost  and 
all  
but there's the 
judgement day
