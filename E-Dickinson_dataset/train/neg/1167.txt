alone and in a 
circumstance 
reluctant to be told 
a spider on my reticence 
assiduously crawled
and so much more at 
home than i 
immediately grew i felt myself a visitor 
and hurriedly withdrew
revisiting my late abode 
with articles of claim i found it quietly assumed 
as a 
gymnasium 
where 
tax asleep and 
title off 
the inmates of the 
air 
perpetual presumption took 
as each were special 
heir  
if any strike me on the street i can return the 
blow if any take my property 
according to the 
law 
the 
statute is my 
learned friend 
but what redress can be 
for an offense nor here nor there 
so not in 
equity  
that 
larceny of time and mind 
the marrow of the 
day 
by spider  or forbid it 
lord 
that i should specify
