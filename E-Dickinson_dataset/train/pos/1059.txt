sang from the 
heart  
sire  
dipped my 
beak in it  
if the 
tune drip too much 
have a tint too red
pardon the 
cochineal suffer the 
vermillion  
death is the 
wealth 
of the 
poorest bird 
bear with the 
ballad  
awkward  faltering  
death twists the strings '
twasn't my blame pause in your 
liturgies wait your 
chorals  
while i repeat your 
hallowed name
