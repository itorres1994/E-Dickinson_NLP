one 
sister have i in our house 
and one a hedge away 
there's only one recorded 
but both belong to me
one came the road that i came  
and wore my last year's gown  
the other as a bird her nest 
builded our hearts among
she did not sing as we did  
it was a different tune  
herself to her a music 
as 
bumble bee of june
today is far from 
childhood  
but up and down the hills i held her hand the tighter  
which shortened all the miles and still her hum 
the years among 
deceives the 
butterfly 
still in her 
eye 
the 
violets lie 
mouldered this many may
i spilt the dew  
but took the morn  i chose this single star 
from out the wide night's numbers  
sue  forevermore
