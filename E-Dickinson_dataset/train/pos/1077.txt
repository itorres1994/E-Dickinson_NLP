these are the 
signs to 
nature's 
inns  
her invitation broad 
to 
whosoever famishing 
to taste her mystic 
bread these are the rites of 
nature's 
house  
the 
hospitality 
that opens with an equal width 
to 
beggar and to 
bee 
for 
sureties of her staunch 
estate 
her undecaying 
cheer 
the 
purple in the 
east is set 
and in the 
north the 
star
