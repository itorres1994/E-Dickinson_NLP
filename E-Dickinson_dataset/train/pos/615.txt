our journey had advanced  
our feet were almost come 
to that odd 
fork in 
being's 
road  
eternity  by 
term our pace took sudden awe  
our feet  reluctant  led  
before  were 
cities  but 
between  
the 
forest of the 
dead retreat  was out of 
hope  
behind  a 
sealed 
route  
eternity's 
white 
flag  
before  
and 
god  at every 
gate
