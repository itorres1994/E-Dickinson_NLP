i tend my flowers for thee  
bright 
absentee  
my 
fuchsia's 
coral 
seams 
rip  while the 
sower  dreams geraniums  tint  and spot  
low 
daisies  dot  
my 
cactus  splits her 
beard 
to show her throat carnations  tip their spice  
and 
bees  pick up  
a 
hyacinth  i hid  
puts out a 
ruffled 
head  
and odors fall 
from flasks  so small you marvel how they held globe 
roses  break their satin flake  
upon my 
garden floor  
yet  thou  not there  i had as lief they bore 
no 
crimson  more thy flower  be gay  
her 
lord  away  
it ill becometh me  
i'll dwell in 
calyx  
gray  
how modestly  alway  
thy 
daisy  
draped for thee
