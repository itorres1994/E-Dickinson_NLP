a 
lady red  amid the 
hill 
her annual secret keeps 
a 
lady white within the 
field 
in placid 
lily sleeps
the tidy 
breezes with their 
brooms  
sweep vale  and hill  and tree 
prithee 
my pretty 
housewives 
who may expected be
the 
neighbors do not yet suspect 
the 
woods exchange a smile 
orchard and 
buttercup and 
bird  
in such a little while
and yet how still the 
landscape stands 
how nonchalant the 
hedge 
as if the 
resurrection 
were nothing very strange
