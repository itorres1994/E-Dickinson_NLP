read  
sweet  how others  strove  
till we  are stouter  
what they  renounced  
till we  are less afraid  
how many times they  bore the faithful witness  
till we  are helped  
as if a 
kingdom  cared 
read then  of faith  
that shone above the fagot  
clear strains of 
hymn 
the 
river could not drown  
brave names of 
men  
and 
celestial 
women  
passed out  of 
record 
into  renown
