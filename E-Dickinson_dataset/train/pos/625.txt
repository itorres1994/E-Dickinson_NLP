625

'twas a long 
parting  but the time 
for 
interview  had 
come  
before the 
judgment 
seat of 
god  
the last  and second time
these 
fleshless 
lovers met  
a 
heaven in a 
gaze  
a 
heaven of 
heavens  the 
privilege 
of one another's 
eyes no 
lifetime  on 
them  
appareled as the new 
unborn  except 
they had beheld born infiniter  now was 
bridal  e'er like 
this  
a 
paradise  the 
host  
and 
cherubim  and 
seraphim  
the unobtrusive 
guest
