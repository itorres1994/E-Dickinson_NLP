this was a 
poet  
it is 
that 
distills amazing sense 
from ordinary 
meanings  
and 
attar so immense
from the familiar species 
that perished by the 
door  
we wonder it was not 
ourselves 
arrested it  before of 
pictures the 
discloser  
the 
poet  it is 
he  
entitles 
us  by 
contrast  
to ceaseless 
poverty of portion  so unconscious  
the 
robbing  could not harm  
himself  to 
him  a 
fortune  
exterior  to 
time
