he put the 
belt around my life i heard the 
buckle snap  
and turned away  imperial  
my 
lifetime folding up  
deliberate  as a 
duke would do 
a 
kingdom's 
title 
deed henceforth  a 
dedicated sort  
a 
member of the cloud 
yet not too far to come at call  
and do the little 
toils 
that make the 
circuit of the 
rest  
and deal occasional smiles 
to lives that stoop to notice mine  
and kindly ask it in  
whose invitation  know you not 
for 
whom i must decline
