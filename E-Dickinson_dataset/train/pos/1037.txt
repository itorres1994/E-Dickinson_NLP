here  where the 
daisies fit my 
head '
tis easiest to lie 
and every 
grass that plays outside 
is sorry  some  for me 
where i am not afraid to go i may confide my 
flower  
who was not 
enemy of 
me 
will gentle be  to her 
nor separate  
herself and 
me 
by 
distances become  
a single 
bloom we constitute 
departed  or at 
home
