126

to fight aloud is very brave  
but gallanter i know 
who charge within the bosom 
the 
cavalry of 
woe who win and nations do not see  
who fall  and none observe  
whose dying eyes no 
country 
regards with patriot love we trust in plumed procession 
for such the 
angels go  
rank after 
rank with even feet  
and 
uniforms of snow
