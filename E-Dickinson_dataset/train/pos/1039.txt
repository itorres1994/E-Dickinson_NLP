1039

i heard  as if i had no 
ear 
until a 
vital 
word 
came all the way from 
life to me 
and then i knew i heard 
i saw  as if my 
eye were on 
another  till a 
thing 
and now i know 'twas 
light  because 
it fitted them  came in 
i dwelt  as if 
myself  were out  
my 
body but within 
until a 
might detected me 
and set my kernel in 
and 
spirit turned unto the 
dust  
old 
friend  thou knowest me   
and 
time went out to tell the 
news 
and met eternity
