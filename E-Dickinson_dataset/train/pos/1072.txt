title divine  is mine 
the 
wife  without the 
sign 
acute 
degree  conferred on me  
empress of 
calvary 
royal  all but the 
crown 
betrothed  without the swoon 
god sends us 
women  
when you  hold  
garnet to 
garnet  
gold  to 
gold  
born  
bridalled  
shrouded  
in a 
day  
tri 
victory 
my 
husband  women say  
stroking the 
melody  
is this  the way
