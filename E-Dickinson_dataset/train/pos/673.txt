the 
love a 
life can show 
below 
is but a filament  i know  
of that diviner thing 
that faints upon the face of 
noon  
and smites the 
tinder in the 
sun  
and hinders 
gabriel's 
wing '
tis this  in 
music  hints and sways  
and far abroad on 
summer days  
distils uncertain pain  '
tis this enamors in the 
east  
and tints the 
transit in the 
west 
with harrowing 
iodine '
tis this  invites  appalls  endows  
flits  glimmers  proves  dissolves  
returns  suggests  convicts  enchants  
then  flings in 
paradise
