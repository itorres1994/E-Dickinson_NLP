as the 
starved 
maelstrom laps the 
navies 
as the 
vulture teased 
forces the 
broods in lonely 
valleys 
as the 
tiger eased
by but a 
crumb of 
blood  fasts 
scarlet 
till he meet a 
man 
dainty adorned with 
veins and 
tissues 
and partakes  his tongue
cooled by the 
morsel for a moment 
grows a fiercer thing 
till he esteem his 
dates and 
cocoa 
a 
nutrition mean
i  of a finer 
famine 
deem my 
supper dry 
for but a 
berry of 
domingo 
and a 
torrid 
eye
