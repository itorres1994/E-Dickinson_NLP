no 
rack can torture me  
my 
soul  at 
liberty  
behind this mortal 
bone 
there knits a bolder 
one you cannot prick with saw  
nor pierce with 
scimitar  
two 
bodies  therefore be  
bind 
one  
the 
other fly the 
eagle of his 
nest 
no easier divest  
and gain the 
sky 
than mayest 
thou except 
thyself may be 
thine 
enemy  
captivity is 
consciousness  
so's liberty
