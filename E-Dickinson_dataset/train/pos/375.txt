375

the 
angle of a 
landscape  
that every time i wake  
between my 
curtain and the 
wall 
upon an ample 
crack like a 
venetian  waiting  
accosts my open eye  
is just a 
bough of 
apples  
held slanting  in the 
sky the 
pattern of a 
chimney  
the 
forehead of a 
hill  
sometimes  a 
vane's 
forefinger  
but that's  
occasional the 
seasons  shift  my 
picture  
upon my 
emerald 
bough  i wake  to find no  
emeralds  
then  
diamonds  which the snow
from 
polar 
caskets  fetched me  
the 
chimney  and the 
hill  
and just the 
steeple's finger  
these  never stir at all
