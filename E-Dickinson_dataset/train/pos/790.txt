nature  the 
gentlest 
mother is  
impatient of no 
child  
the feeblest  or the waywardest  
her 
admonition mild in 
forest  and the 
hill  
by 
traveller  be heard  
restraining 
rampant 
squirrel  
or too impetuous 
bird how fair 
her 
conversation  
a 
summer 
afternoon  
her 
household  
her 
assembly  
and when the 
sung go down her 
voice among the 
aisles 
incite the timid prayer 
of the minutest 
cricket the most unworthy 
flower when all the 
children sleep  
she turns as long away 
as will suffice to light 
her lamps  
then bending from the 
sky with infinite 
affection  
and infiniter 
care  
her 
golden finger on 
her lip  
wills 
silence  
everywhere
