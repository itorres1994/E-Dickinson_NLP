1221

some we see no more 
tenements of 
wonder 
occupy to us though perhaps to them 
simpler are the 
days than the 
supposition 
leave us to presume
that oblique 
belief which we call 
conjecture 
grapples with a 
theme stubborn as 
sublime 
able as the 
dust to equip its feature 
adequate as 
drums 
to enlist the tomb
