love  thou art high  i cannot climb thee  
but  were it 
two  
who know but we  
taking turns  at the 
chimborazo  
ducal  at last  stand up by thee love  thou are deep  i cannot cross thee  
but  were there 
two 
instead of 
one  
rower  and 
yacht  some sovereign 
summer  
who knows  but we'd reach the sun 
love  thou are 
veiled  
a few  behold thee  
smile  and alter  and prattle  and die  
bliss  were an 
oddity  without thee  
nicknamed by 
god  
eternity
