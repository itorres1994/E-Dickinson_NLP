love  is that later 
thing than 
death  
more previous  than 
life  
confirms it at its entrance  
and 
usurps it  of itself tastes 
death  the first  to hand the sting 
the 
second  to its friend  
disarms the little interval  
deposits 
him with 
god then hovers  an inferior 
guard  
lest this 
beloved 
charge 
need  once in an 
eternity  
a smaller than the 
large
