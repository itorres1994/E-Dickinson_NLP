went up a year this evening  i recollect it well  
amid no bells nor bravoes 
the bystanders will tell  
cheerful  as to the village  
tranquil  as to repose  
chastened  as to the 
chapel 
this humble 
tourist rose  
did not talk of returning  
alluded to no time 
when  were the gales propitious  
we might look for him  
was grateful for the 
roses 
in life's diverse bouquet  
talked softly of new species 
to pick another day  
beguiling thus the wonder 
the wondrous nearer drew  
hands bustled at the moorings  
the crown respectful grew  
ascended from our vision 
to 
countenances new  
a 
difference  
a 
daisy  
is all the rest i knew
