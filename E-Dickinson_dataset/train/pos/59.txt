a little 
east of 
jordan 
evangelists record 
a 
gymnast and an 
angel 
did wrestle long and hard till morning touching mountain  
and 
jacob waxing strong 
the 
angel begged permission 
to 
breakfast  to return not so said cunning 
jacob 
i will not let thee go 
except thou bless me  
stranger 
the which acceded to light swung the silver fleeces 
peniel 
hills beyond 
and the bewildered 
gymnast 
found he had worsted god
