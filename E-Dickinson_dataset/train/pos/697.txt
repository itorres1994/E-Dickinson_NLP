i could bring 
you 
jewels  had i a mind to  
but 
you have enough  of those  i could bring 
you 
odors from 
st  
domingo  
colors  from 
vera 
cruz berries of the 
bahamas  have i  
but this little 
blaze 
flickering to itself  in the 
meadow  
suits 
me  more than those never a 
fellow matched this 
topaz and his 
emerald 
swing  
dower itself  for 
bobadilo  
better  
could i bring
