i went to 
heaven  '
twas a small 
town  
lit  with a 
ruby  
lathed  with 
down stiller  than the fields 
at the full 
dew  
beautiful  as 
pictures no 
man drew  
people  like the 
moth  
of 
mechlin  frames  
duties  of 
gossamer and 
eider  names  
almost  contented  i  could be  '
mong such unique 
society
