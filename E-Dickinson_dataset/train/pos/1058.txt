bloom  is 
result  to meet a 
flower 
and casually glance 
would scarcely cause one to suspect 
the minor circumstance
assisting in the 
bright 
affair 
so intricately done 
then offered as a 
butterfly 
to the 
meridian to pack the 
bud  oppose the 
worm  
obtain its right of 
dew  
adjust the 
heat  elude the 
wind escape the prowling bee
great 
nature not to disappoint 
awaiting 
her that 
day  
to be a 
flower  is profound 
responsibility
