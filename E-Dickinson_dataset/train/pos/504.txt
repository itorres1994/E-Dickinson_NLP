you know that 
portrait in the 
moon  
so tell me who 'tis like  
the very 
brow  the stooping eyes  
a fog for  
say  
whose sake
the very 
pattern of the 
cheek  
it varies  in the 
chin  
but  
ishmael  since we met  'tis long  
and fashions  intervene when 
moon's at full  '
tis 
thou  i say  
my lips just hold the name  
when crescent  
thou art worn  i note  
but  there  the 
golden 
same and when  
some 
night  
bold  slashing 
clouds 
cut 
thee away from 
me  
that's easier  than the other film 
that glazes 
holiday
