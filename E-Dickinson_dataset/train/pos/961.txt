wert 
thou but ill  that i might show thee 
how long a 
day i could endure 
though thine attention stop not on me 
nor the least signal  
me assure wert 
thou but 
stranger in ungracious country  
and 
mine  the 
door 
thou paused at  for a passing bounty  
no 
more accused  wert 
thou  and 
myself  
tribunal convicted  
sentenced  
ermine  not to 
me 
half the 
condition  thy 
reverse  to follow  
just to partake  the infamy the 
tenant of the 
narrow 
cottage  wert 
thou  
permit to be 
the 
housewife in thy low attendance 
contenteth 
me no 
service hast 
thou  i would not achieve it  
to die  or live  
the first  
sweet  proved 
i  ere i saw thee  
for 
life  be 
love
