the 
lilac is an ancient shrub 
but ancienter than that 
the 
firmamental 
lilac 
upon the 
hill tonight  
the 
sun subsiding on his 
course 
bequeaths this final 
plant 
to 
contemplation  not to 
touch  
the 
flower of 
occident 
of one 
corolla is the 
west  
the 
calyx is the 
earth  
the 
capsules burnished 
seeds the 
stars 
the 
scientist of 
faith 
his research has but just begun above his synthesis 
the 
flora unimpeachable 
to 
time's 
analysis  
eye hath not seen may possibly 
be current with the 
blind 
but let not 
revelation 
by theses be detained
