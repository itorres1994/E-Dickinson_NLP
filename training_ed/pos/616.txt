i rose  because 
he sank  i thought it would be opposite  
but when his power dropped  
my 
soul grew straight
i cheered my fainting 
prince  i sang firm  even  
chants  i helped his 
film  with 
hymn and when the 
dews drew off 
that held his 
forehead stiff  i met him  
balm to 
balm i told him 
best  must pass 
through this low 
arch of 
flesh  
no 
casque so brave 
it spurn the 
grave i told him 
worlds i knew 
where 
emperors grew  
who recollected us 
if we were true and so with 
thews of 
hymn  
and 
sinew from within  
and ways i knew not that i knew  till then  i lifted 
him
