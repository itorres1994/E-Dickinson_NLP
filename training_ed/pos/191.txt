the 
skies can't keep their secret 
they tell it to the 
hills  
the 
hills just tell the 
orchards  
and they  the daffodils
a 
bird  by chance  that goes that way  
soft overhears the whole  
if i should bribe the little 
bird  
who knows but she would tell
i think i won't  however  
it's finer  not to know  
if 
summer were an 
axiom  
what sorcery had snow
so keep your secret  
father i would not  if i could 
know what the 
sapphire 
fellows do 
in your newfashioned world
