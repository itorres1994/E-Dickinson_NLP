i have a 
bird in spring
which for myself doth sing the spring decoys
and as the summer nears and as the 
rose appears
robin is gone
yet do i not repine
knowing that 
bird of mine
though flown learneth beyond the sea
melody new for me
and will return
fast is a safer hand
held in a truer land
are mine and though they now depart
tell i my doubting heart
they're thine
in a serener bright
in a more golden light
i see
each little doubt and fear
each little discord here
removed
then will i not repine
knowing that 
bird of mine
though flown
shall in a distant tree
bright melody for me
return
