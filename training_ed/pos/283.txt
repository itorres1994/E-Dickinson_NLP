a 
mien to move a 
queen  
half 
child  
half 
heroine  
an 
orleans in the 
eye 
that puts its manner by 
for humbler 
company 
when none are near 
even a 
tear  
its frequent 
visitor a 
bonnet like a 
duke  
and yet a 
wren's 
peruke 
were not so shy 
of 
goer by  
and 
hands  so slight  
they would elate a 
sprite 
with 
merriment a 
voice that 
alters  
low 
and on the 
ear can go 
like 
let of 
snow  
or shift supreme  
as tone of 
realm 
on 
subjects 
diadem too small  to fear  
too distant  to endear  
and so 
men 
compromise 
and just  revere
