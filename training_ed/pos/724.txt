it's easy to invent a 
life  
god does it  every 
day  
creation  but the 
gambol 
of 
his 
authority it's easy to efface it  
the thrifty 
deity 
could scarce afford 
eternity 
to 
spontaneity the 
perished 
patterns murmur  
but 
his 
perturbless 
plan 
proceed  inserting 
here  a 
sun  
there  leaving out a 
man
