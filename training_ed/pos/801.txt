i play at 
riches  to appease 
the 
clamoring for 
gold  
it kept me from a 
thief i think 
for often overbold
with 
want and 
opportunity  i could have done a 
sin 
and been 
myself that easy 
thing 
an independent 
man but often as my lot displays 
too hungry to be borne i deem 
myself what i would be  
and novel comforting
my 
poverty and i derive  
we question if the 
man  
who own  
esteem the 
opulence  
as 
we  
who never 
can should ever these exploring 
hands 
chance 
sovereign on a 
mine  
or in the long  uneven term 
to win become their turn  
how fitter they will be  for 
want  
enlightening so well  i know not which 
desire or 
grant  
be wholly beautiful
