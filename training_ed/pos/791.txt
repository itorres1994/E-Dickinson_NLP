god gave a 
loaf to every 
bird  
but just a 
crumb  to 
me  i dare not eat it  tho' i starve  
my poignant luxury to own it  touch it  
prove the feat  that made the 
pellet mine  
too happy  for my 
sparrow's chance  
for 
ampler 
coveting it might be 
famine  all around  i could not miss an 
ear  
such 
plenty smiles upon my 
board  
my 
garner shows so fair i wonder how the 
rich  may feel  
an 
indiaman  
an 
earl  i deem that i  with but a 
crumb  
am 
sovereign of them all
