the 
gentian has a parched 
corolla  
like azure dried '
tis 
nature's buoyant juices 
beatified  
without a vaunt or sheen 
as casual as 
rain 
and as benign when most is part  it comes  
nor isolate it seems 
its 
bond its 
friend  
to fill its 
fringed career 
and aid an aged 
year 
abundant end its lot  were it forgot this 
truth endear  
fidelity is gain 
creation is o'er
