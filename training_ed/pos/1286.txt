i thought that nature was enough 
till 
human nature came 
but that the other did absorb 
as 
parallax a 
flame of 
human nature just aware 
there added the 
divine 
brief struggle for capacity 
the power to contain
is always as the contents 
but give a 
giant room 
and you will lodge a 
giant 
and not a smaller man
