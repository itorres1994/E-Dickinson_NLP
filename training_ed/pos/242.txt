when we stand on the tops of 
things  
and like the 
trees look down  
the smoke all cleared away from it  
and 
mirrors on the scene just laying light  no soul will wink 
except it have the flaw  
the 
sound ones like the 
hills  shall stand  
no 
lighting scares away the 
perfect nowhere be afraid  
they bear their dauntless 
heads 
where others dare not go at 
noon 
protected by their deeds the 
stars dare shine occasionally 
upon a spotted 
world  
and 
suns go surer for their 
proof 
as if an 
axle held
