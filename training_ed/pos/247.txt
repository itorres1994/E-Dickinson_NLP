what would i give to see his face 
i'd give  
i'd give my life  of course  
but that is not enough 
stop just a minute  let me think 
i'd give my biggest 
bobolink 
that makes two  
him  and 
life 
you know who 
june is  
i'd give her  
roses a day from 
zanzibar  
and 
lily tubes  like 
wells  
bees  by the furlong  
straits of 
blue 
navies of 
butterflies  sailed thro' and dappled 
cowslip 
dells then i have shares in 
primrose 
banks  
daffodil 
dowries  spicy 
stocks  
dominions  broad as 
dew  
bags of 
doublons  adventurous 
bees 
brought me  from firmamental seas  
and 
purple  from 
peru now  have i bought it  
shylock 
say 
sign me the 
bond 
i vow to pay 
to 
her  who pledges this  
one hour  of her 
sovereign's face 
ecstatic 
contract 
niggard 
grace 
my 
kingdom's worth of bliss
