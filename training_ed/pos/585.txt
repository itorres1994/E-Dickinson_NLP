i like to see it lap the 
miles  
and lick the 
valleys up  
and stop to feed itself at 
tanks  
and then  prodigious step
around a 
pile of 
mountains  
and supercilious peer 
in 
shanties  by the sides of 
roads  
and then a 
quarry pare
to fit its 
ribs 
and crawl between 
complaining all the while 
in horrid  hooting stanza  
then chase itself down 
hill and neigh like 
boanerges  
then  punctual as a 
star 
stop  docile and omnipotent 
at its own stable door
