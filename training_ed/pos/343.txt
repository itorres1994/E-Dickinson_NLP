my 
reward for 
being was 
this 
my premium  
my 
bliss  
an 
admiralty less  
a 
sceptre  penniless  
and 
realms  just 
dross when 
thrones accost my 
hands  
with 
me 
miss 
me  
i'll unroll 
thee  
dominions dowerless  beside this 
grace  
election  
vote  
the 
ballots of 
eternity will show just that
