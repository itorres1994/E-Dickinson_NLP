flowers that heard the news of 
dews 
but never deemed the dripping prize 
awaited their  low 
brows  
or 
bees  that thought the 
summer's name 
some rumor of 
delirium

summer  could  for 
them or 
arctic 
creatures dimly stirred  
by 
tropic 
hint  some 
travelled 
bird 
imported to the 
wood or 
wind's bright signal to the 
ear  
making that homely and severe 
contented known before the 
heaven  unexpected come 
to 
lives that thought the 
worshipping 
a too presumptuous 
psalm
