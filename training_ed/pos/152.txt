the 
sun kept stooping  stooping  low 
the 
hills to meet him rose 
on his side what 
transaction 
on their side what repose
deeper and deeper grew the stain 
upon the window pane  
thicker and thicker stood the feet 
until the tyrian
was crowded dense with 
armies  
so gay so 
brigadier  
that i felt martial stirrings 
who once the 
cockade wore  
charged from my chimney corner  
but 
nobody was there
