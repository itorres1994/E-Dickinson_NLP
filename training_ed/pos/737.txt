the 
moon was but a 
chin of 
gold 
a 
night or two ago  
and now she turns 
her perfect 
face 
upon the 
world below her 
forehead is of 
amplest 
blonde her 
cheek  a 
beryl hewn  
her 
eye unto the 
summer 
dew 
the likest i have known her 
lips of 
amber never part  
but what must be the smile 
upon 
her 
friend she could confer 
were such 
her 
silver 
will and what a privilege to be 
but the remotest 
star  
for 
certainty 
she take 
her 
way 
beside 
your 
palace 
door her 
bonnet is the 
firmament  
the 
universe  
her 
shoe  
the 
stars  the 
trinkets at 
her 
belt  
her 
dimities  of 
blue
