tho' my destiny be 
fustian  
hers be damask fine  
tho' she wear a silver apron  
i a less divine still my little 
gypsy being i would far prefer 
still my little sunburnt bosom 
to her 
rosier 
for when 
frosts their punctual fingers 
on her forehead lay 
you and 
i and 
dr 
holland 
bloom eternally
roses of a steadfast summer 
in a steadfast land 
where no 
autumn lifts her pencil  
and no 
reapers stand
