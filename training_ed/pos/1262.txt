i cannot see my soul but know 'tis there 
nor ever saw his house nor furniture 
who has invited me with him to dwell 
but a confiding guest consult as well 
what raiment honor him the most 
that i be adequately dressed 
for he insures to none 
lest men specified adorn 
procuring him perpetual drest 
by dating it a sudden feast
