i gained it so  
by 
climbing slow  
by 
catching at the 
twigs that grow 
between the 
bliss  and me  
it hung so high 
as well the 
sky 
attempt by 
strategy i said i gained it  
this  was all  
look how i clutch it 
lest it fall  
and i a 
pauper go  
unfitted by an instant's 
grace 
for the 
contented  
beggar's face i wore  an hour ago
