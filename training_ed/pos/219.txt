she sweeps with manycolored 
brooms  
and leaves the 
shreds behind  
oh 
housewife in the 
evening 
west come back and dust the pond
you dropped a 
purple 
ravelling in you dropped an 
amber thread  
and how you've littered all the 
east 
with duds of emerald
and still she plies her spotted 
brooms 
and still the 
aprons fly 
till 
brooms fade softly into stars  
and then i come away
