i died for 
beauty  but was scarce 
adjusted in the 
tomb 
when 
one who died for 
truth was lain 
in an adjoining room he questioned softly 
why i failed 
for 
beauty i replied  
and i  for 
truth  
themself are 
one  
we 
brethren are 
he said and so as 
kinsmen met a 
night  
we talked between the 
rooms  
until the 
moss had reached our lips  
and covered up  our names
