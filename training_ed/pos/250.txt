i shall keep singing 
birds will pass me 
on their way to 
yellower 
climes  
each  with a 
robin's expectation i  with my 
redbreast  
and my 
rhymes late  when i take my place in summer  
but  i shall bring a fuller tune  
vespers  are sweeter than 
matins  
signor  
morning  only the seed of 
noon
