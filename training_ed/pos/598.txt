three times  we parted  
breath  and i  
three times  
he would not go  
but strove to stir the lifeless 
fan 
the 
waters  strove to stay
three 
times  the 
billows tossed me up  
then caught me  like a 
ball  
then made 
blue faces in my face  
and pushed away a sail
that crawled 
leagues off  i liked to see  
for thinking  while i die  
how pleasant to behold a 
thing 
where 
human faces  be the 
waves grew sleepy  
breath  did not  
the 
winds  like 
children  lulled then 
sunrise kissed my 
chrysalis  
and i stood up  and lived
