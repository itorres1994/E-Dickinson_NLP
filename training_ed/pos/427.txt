i'll clutch  and clutch  
next  
one  
might be the golden touch  
could take it  
diamonds  
wait  
i'm diving  just a little late  
but stars  go slow  for night i'll string you  in fine 
necklace  
tiaras  make  of some  
wear you on 
hem  
loop up a 
countess  with you  
make  a 
diadem  and mend my old 
one  
count  
hoard  then lose  
and doubt that you are mine  
to have the joy of feeling it  again i'll show you at the 
court  
bear you  for 
ornament 
where 
women breathe  
that every sigh  may lift you 
just as high  as i and  when i die  
in meek array  display you  
still to show  how rich i go  
lest 
skies impeach a wealth so wonderful  
and banish me
