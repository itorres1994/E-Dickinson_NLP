i have never seen 
volcanoes  
but when 
travellers tell 
how those old  phlegmatic mountains 
usually so still bear within  appalling 
ordnance 
fire and smoke and gun 
taking 
villages for breakfast 
and appalling 
men if the stillness is 
volcanic 
in the human face 
when upon a pain 
titanic 
features keep their place if at length the smouldering anguish 
will not overcome  
and the palpitating 
vineyard 
in the dust be thrown
if some loving 
antiquary 
on 
resumption 
morn 
will not cry with joy 
pompeii 
to the 
hills return
