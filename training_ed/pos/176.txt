i'm the little 
heart's 
ease i don't care for pouting skies 
if the 
butterfly delay 
can 
i therefore stay away
if the 
coward 
bumble 
bee 
in his chimney corner stay 
i must resoluter be 
who'll apologize for me
dear 
old fashioned little flower 
eden is old fashioned too 
birds are antiquated fellows 
heaven does not change her blue 
nor will 
i the little 
heart's 
ease  
ever be induced to do
