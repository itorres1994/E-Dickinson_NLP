had i presumed to hope  
the loss had been to 
me 
a 
value  for the 
greatness' 
sake as 
giants  gone away had i presumed to gain 
a 
favor so remote  
the failure but confirm the 
grace 
in further 
infinite '
tis failure  not of 
hope  
but 
confident 
despair  
advancing on 
celestial 
lists  
with faint  
terrestial power  '
tis 
honor  though i die  
for 
that no 
man obtain 
till 
he be justified by 
death  
this  is the 
second 
gain
