if i may have it when it's dead 
i'll be contented  so  
if just as soon as 
breath is out 
it shall belong to me until they lock it in the 
grave '
tis 
bliss i cannot weigh  
for tho' they lock 
thee in the 
grave 
myself  can own the key think of it 
lover i and 
thee 
permitted  face to face to be  
after a 
life  a 
death  
we'll say  
for 
death was 
that  
and this  is 
thee i'll tell 
thee 
all  how 
bald it grew  
how 
midnight felt at first  to me  
how all the 
clocks stopped in the 
world  
and 
sunshine pinched me  '
twas so cold  
then how the 
grief got sleepy  some  
as if my 
soul were deaf and dumb  
just making signs  across  to 
thee  
that this way  thou could'st notice me i'll tell you how i tried to keep 
a smile to show you when this 
deep 
all 
waded  
we look back for 
play 
at those 
old 
times  in calvary
forgive me if the 
grave come slow  
for 
coveting to look at 
thee  
forgive me if to stroke thy frost 
outvisions paradise
