of all the 
sounds despatched abroad 
there's not a 
charge to me 
like that old measure in the 
boughs  
that phraseless 
melody  
the 
wind does  working like a 
hand 
whose fingers 
comb the 
sky  
then quiver down  with tufts of 
tune  
permitted 
gods and me inheritance it is to us  
beyond the 
art to 
earn  
beyond the trait to take away 
by 
robber since the 
gain 
is gotten not of fingers  
and inner than the 
bone  
hid golden for the whole of 
days 
and even in the 
urn i cannot vouch the merry 
dust 
do not arise and play 
in some odd fashion of its own 
some quainter 
holiday 
when 
winds go round and round in 
bands  
and thrum upon the door 
and 
birds take places overhead 
to bear them orchestra
i crave 
him grace of 
summer 
boughs 
if such an 
outcast be  
who never heard that fleshless 
chant  
rise  solemn  on the 
tree 
as if some 
caravan of 
sound 
off 
deserts in the 
sky 
had parted 
rank 
then knit and swept  
in 
seamless 
company
