the 
day that i was crowned 
was like the other 
days  
until the 
coronation came  
and then  'twas 
otherwise as 
carbon in the 
coal 
and 
carbon in the 
gem 
are 
one  and yet the former 
were dull for 
diadem i rose and all was plain but when the 
day declined 
myself and 
it in 
majesty 
were equally  adorned the 
grace that i  was chose  
to 
me  surpassed the 
crown 
that was the 
witness for the 
grace  '
twas even that 'twas 
mine
