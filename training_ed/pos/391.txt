a 
visitor in 
marl  
who influences 
flowers  
till they are orderly as 
busts  
and 
elegant  as 
glass who visits in the 
night  
and just before the 
sun  
concludes his glistening interview  
caresses  and is gone but whom his fingers touched  
and where his feet have run  
and whatsoever 
mouth be kissed  
is as it had not been
