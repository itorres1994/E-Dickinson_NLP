i'll tell you how the 
sun rose  
a 
ribbon at a time  
the 
steeples swam in 
amethyst  
the news like 
squirrels ran  
the 
hills untied their 
bonnets  
the 
bobolinks  begun  
then i said softly to myself  
that must have been the 
sun 
but how he set  i know not  
there seemed a purple stile 
that little 
yellow boys and girls 
were climbing all the while  
till when they reached the other side 
a 
dominie in 
gray  
put gently up the evening 
bars  
and led the flock away
