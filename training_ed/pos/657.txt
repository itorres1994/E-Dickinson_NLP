i dwell in 
possibility  
a fairer 
house than 
prose  
more numerous of 
windows  
superior  for 
doors of 
chambers as the 
cedars  
impregnable of 
eye  
and for an 
everlasting 
roof 
the 
gambrels of the 
sky of 
visitors  the fairest  
for 
occupation  
this  
the spreading wide of narrow 
hands 
to gather 
paradise
