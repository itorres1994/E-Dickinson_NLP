forever  it composed of 
nows  '
tis not a different time  
except for 
infiniteness  
and 
latitude of 
home from this  experienced 
here  
remove the 
dates  to 
these  
let 
months dissolve in further 
months  
and 
years  exhale in 
years  
without 
debate  or 
pause  
or 
celebrated 
days  
no different 
our 
years would be 
from 
anno 
domini's
