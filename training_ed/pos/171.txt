wait till the 
majesty of 
death 
invests so mean a brow 
almost a powdered 
footman 
might dare to touch it now
wait till in 
everlasting 
robes 
that 
democrat is dressed 
then prate about 
preferment  
and 
station and the rest
around this quiet 
courtier 
obsequious 
angels wait 
full royal is his 
retinue 
full purple is his state
a 
lord might dare to lift the 
hat 
to such a 
modest 
clay 
since that 
my 
lord the 
lord of 
lords 
receives unblushingly
