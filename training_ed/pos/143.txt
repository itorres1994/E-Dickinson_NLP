for every 
bird a 
nest  
wherefore in timid quest 
some little 
wren goes seeking round wherefore when boughs are free households in every tree  
pilgrim be found
perhaps a home too high  
ah 
aristocracy 
the little 
wren desires perhaps of twig so fine of twine e'en superfine 
her pride aspires the 
lark is not ashamed 
to build upon the ground 
her modest house yet who of all the throng 
dancing around the sun 
does so rejoice
