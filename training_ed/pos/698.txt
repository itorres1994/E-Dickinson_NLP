life  is what we make of it  
death  we do not know  
christ's acquaintance with 
him 
justify 
him  though he  would trust no stranger  
other  could betray  
just 
his own endorsement  
that  sufficeth 
me all the other 
distance 
he hath traversed first no 
new 
mile remaineth  
far as 
paradise his sure foot preceding tender 
pioneer  
base must be the 
coward 
dare not venture  now
