166

 i met a 
king this afternoon 
he had not on a 
crown indeed 
a little 
palmleaf 
hat was all 
and he was barefoot 
i'm afraid
but sure i am he 
ermine wore 
beneath his faded 
jacket's blue  
and sure i am the crest he bore 
within that 
jacket's pocket too
for 'twas too stately for an 
earl  
a 
marquis would not go so grand '
twas possibly a 
czar petite  
a 
pope or something of that kind
if i must tell you of a 
horse 
my freckled 
monarch held the rein doubtless an estimable 
beast 
but not at all disposed to run
and such a wagon 
while i live 
dare i presume to see 
another such a vehicle 
as then transported me
two other ragged 
princes 
his royal state partook 
doubtless the first excursion 
these sovereigns ever took
i question if the 
royal 
coach 
round which the 
footmen wait 
has the significance on high 
of this 
barefoot estate
