505

 i would not paint  a picture  
i'd rather be the 
one 
its bright impossibility 
to dwell  delicious  on  
and wonder how the fingers feel 
whose rare  celestial  stir  
evokes so sweet a 
torment  
such sumptuous  
despair i would not talk like 
cornets  
i'd rather be the 
one 
raised softly to the 
ceilings  
and out and easy on  
through 
villages of 
ether  
myself endued 
balloon 
by but a lip of 
metal  
the pier to my 
pontoon nor would i be a 
poet  
it's finer  own the 
ear  
enamored  impotent  content  
the 
license to revere 
a privilege so awful 
what would the 
dower be 
had i the 
art to stun myself 
with 
bolts of melody
