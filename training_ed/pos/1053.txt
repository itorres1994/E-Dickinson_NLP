1053

it was a quiet way  
he asked if i was his  i made no answer of the 
tongue 
but answer of the 
eyes  
and then 
he bore me on 
before this mortal noise 
with swiftness as of 
chariots 
and distance as of 
wheels 
this 
world did drop away 
as 
acres from the feet 
of one that leaneth from 
balloon 
upon an 
ether street 
the 
gulf behind was not 
the 
continents were new  
eternity it was before 
eternity was due 
no 
seasons were to us  
it was not 
night nor 
morn  
but 
sunrise stopped upon the place 
and fastened it in dawn
