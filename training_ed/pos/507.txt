she sights a 
bird  she chuckles she flattens  then she crawls  
she runs without the look of feet  
her eyes increase to 
balls her 
jaws stir  twitching  hungry  
her 
teeth can hardly stand  
she leaps but 
robin leaped the first  
ah 
pussy of the sand
the 
hopes so juicy ripening  
you almost bathed your 
tongue  
when 
bliss disclosed a hundred 
toes  
and fled with every one
