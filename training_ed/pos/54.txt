if i should die 
and you should live  
and time should gurgle on  
and morn should beam  
and noon should burn  
as it has usual done  
if 
birds should build as early 
and 
bees as bustling go  
one might depart at option 
from enterprise below '
tis sweet to know that stocks will stand 
when we with 
daisies lie  
that 
commerce will continue  
and 
trades as briskly fly  
it makes the parting tranquil 
and keeps the soul serene  
that gentlemen so sprightly 
conduct the pleasing scene
