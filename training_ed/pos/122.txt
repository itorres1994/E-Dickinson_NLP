a something in a summer's 
day 
as slow her flambeaux burn away 
which solemnizes me 
a something in a summer's noon  
a depth  an 
azure  a perfume  
transcending ecstasy
and still within a summer's night 
a something so transporting bright i clap my hands to see then veil my too inspecting face 
lets such a subtle  shimmering grace 
flutter too far for me the wizard fingers never rest  
the purple brook within the breast 
still chafes it narrow bed still rears the 
east her amber 
flag  
guides still the sun along the 
crag 
his 
caravan of 
red so looking on  the night  the morn 
conclude the wonder gay  
and i meet coming thro' the dews 
another summer's day
