a 
wife  at daybreak i shall be  
sunrise  
hast thou a 
flag for me 
at 
midnight i am but a 
maid 
how short it takes to make a 
bride then  
midnight i have passed from thee 
unto the 
east and 
victory  
midnight  
good 
night i hear them call 
the 
angels bustle in the 
hall  
softly my 
future climbs the 
stair i fumble at my 
childhood's prayer 
so soon to be a 
child no more  
eternity 
i'm coming  
sire 
savior  
i've seen the face  before
