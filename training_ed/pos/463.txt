i live with 
him  i see 
his face  i go no more away 
for 
visitor  or 
sundown  
death's single privacy
the 
only 
one  forestalling 
mine and that  by 
right that 
he 
presents a 
claim invisible  
no wedlock  granted 
me i live with 
him  i hear 
his 
voice i stand alive  
today  
to witness to the 
certainty 
of 
immortality taught 
me  by 
time  the lower 
way  
conviction  
every day  
that 
life like 
this  is stopless  
be 
judgment  what it may
