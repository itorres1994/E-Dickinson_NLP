103

i have a 
king who does not speak so  wondering  thro' the hours meek i trudge the day away  
half glad when it is night and sleep 
if haply thro' a dream to peep 
in parlors shut by day
and if i do  when morning comes  
it is as if a hundred drums 
did round my pillow roll 
and shouts fill all my 
childish sky 
and 
bells keep saying 
victory 
from steeples in my soul
and if i don't  the little 
bird 
within the 
orchard is not heard 
and i omit to pray 
father thy will be done today 
for my will goes the other way 
and it were perjury
