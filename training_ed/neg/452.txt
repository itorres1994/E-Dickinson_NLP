the 
malay  took the 
pearl  
not  i  the 
earl  i  feared the 
sea  too much 
unsanctified  to touch praying that i might be 
worthy  the 
destiny  
the 
swarthy fellow swam  
and bore my 
jewel  
home  
home to the 
hut 
what lot 
had i  the 
jewel  got  
borne on a 
dusky 
breast  i had not deemed a 
vest 
of 
amber  fit the 
negro never knew i  wooed it  too  
to gain or be undone  
alike to 
him  
one
