tell as a 
marksman  were forgotten 
tell  this 
day endures 
ruddy as that coeval 
apple 
the 
tradition bears fresh as 
mankind that humble story 
though a statelier 
tale 
grown in the 
repetition hoary 
scarcely would prevail tell had a son  
the ones that knew it 
need not linger here  
those who did not to 
human 
nature 
will subscribe a 
tear tell would not bare his 
head 
in 
presence 
of the 
ducal 
hat  
threatened for that with 
death  by 
gessler  
tyranny bethought
make of his only 
boy a 
target 
that surpasses 
death  
stolid to 
love's supreme entreaty 
not forsook of 
faith mercy of the 
almighty begging  
tell his 
arrow sent  
god it is said replies in 
person 
when the cry is meant
