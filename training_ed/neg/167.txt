to learn the 
transport by the 
pain 
as 
blind 
men learn the sun 
to die of thirst  suspecting 
that 
brooks in 
meadows run 
to stay the homesick  homesick feet 
upon a foreign shore  
haunted by native lands the while and blue  beloved air
this is the 
sovereign 
anguish 
this  the signal woe 
these are the patient 
laureates 
whose voices  trained  below ascend in ceaseless 
carol  
inaudible indeed 
to us  the duller scholars 
of the 
mysterious bard
