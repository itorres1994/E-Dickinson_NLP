i had a guinea golden  i lost it in the sand  
and tho' the sum was simple 
and pounds were in the land  
still had it such a value 
unto my frugal eye  
that when i could not find it  i sat me down to sigh
i had a crimson 
robin  
who sang full many a day 
but when the woods were painted 
he too did fly away time brought me other 
robins  
their ballads were the same  
still for my missing 
troubador i kept the house at hame
i had a star in heaven  
one 
pleiad was its name  
and when i was not heeding 
it wandered from the same 
and tho' the skies are crowded  
and all the night ashine  i do not care about it  
since none of them are mine
my story has a moral  i have a missing friend 
pleiad its name and 
robin 
and guinea in the sand 
and when this mournful ditty 
accompanied with tear  
shall meet the eye of traitor 
in country far from here  
grant that repentance solemn 
may seize upon his mind  
and he no consolation 
beneath the sun may find
