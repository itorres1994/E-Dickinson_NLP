a 
dying 
tiger  moaned for 
drink  i hunted all the 
sand  i caught the 
dripping of a 
rock 
and bore it in my 
hand his 
mighty 
balls  in death were thick  
but searching  i could see 
a 
vision on the 
retina 
of 
water  and of me  '
twas not my blame  who sped too slow  '
twas not his blame  who died 
while i was reaching him  
but 'twas  the fact that 
he was dead
