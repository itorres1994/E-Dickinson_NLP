struck was 
i not yet by 
lightning lightning  lets away 
power to perceive 
his 
process 
with vitality
maimed  was i  yet not by 
venture  
stone of stolid 
boy  
nor a 
sportsman's 
peradventure  
who mine enemy
robbed  was i  intact to 
bandit  
all my 
mansion torn  
sun  withdrawn to 
recognition  
furthest shining  done yet was not the foe  of any  
not the smallest 
bird 
in the nearest 
orchard dwelling 
be of 
me  afraid
most  i love the 
cause that slew 
me 
often as i die 
its beloved 
recognition 
holds a 
sun on 
me best  at 
setting  as is 
nature's  
neither witnessed 
rise 
till the infinite 
aurora 
in the other's eyes
