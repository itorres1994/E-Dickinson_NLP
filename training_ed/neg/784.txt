bereaved of all i went abroad  
no less bereaved was i 
upon a 
new 
peninsula  
the 
grave preceded me obtained my 
lodgings ere myself  
and when i sought my 
bed  
the 
grave it was reposed upon 
the 
pillow for my 
head i waked to find it first awake  i rose  
it followed me  i tried to drop it in the 
crowd  
to lose it in the 
sea in 
cups of artificial 
drowse 
to steep its shape away  
the 
grave  was finished  but the 
spade 
remained in 
memory
