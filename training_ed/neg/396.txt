396

there is a 
languor of the 
life 
more imminent than 
pain  '
tis 
pain's 
successor  
when the 
soul 
has suffered all it can a 
drowsiness  diffuses  
a 
dimness like a 
fog 
envelops 
consciousness  
as 
mists  obliterate a crag
the 
surgeon  does not blanch  at pain 
his 
habit  is severe  
but tell him that it ceased to feel  
the 
creature lying there and he will tell you  skill is late  
a 
mightier than 
he  
has ministered before 
him  
there's no vitality
