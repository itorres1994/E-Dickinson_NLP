your 
riches  taught me  
poverty 
myself  a 
millionaire 
in little 
wealths as 
girls could boast 
till broad as 
buenos 
ayre you drifted your 
dominions  
a 
different 
peru  
and i esteemed 
all 
poverty 
for 
life's 
estate with you of 
mines i little know  myself  
but just the names of 
gems  
the 
colors of the 
commonest  
and scarce of 
diadems so much that did i meet the 
queen  
her 
glory i should know  
but this must be a different 
wealth to miss it  beggars so i'm sure 'tis 
india  all 
day  
to those who look on 
you  
without a stint  without a blame 
might i  but be the 
jew i'm sure it is 
golconda  
beyond my power to deem  
to have a smile for 
mine  each 
day 
how better than a gem
at least it solaces to know 
that there exists  a 
gold  
altho' i prove it just in time 
its distance  to behold its far  far 
treasure to surmise  
and estimate the 
pearl  
that slipped my simple fingers through  
while just a 
girl at school
