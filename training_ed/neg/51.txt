i often passed the village 
when going home from school  
and wondered what they did there  
and why it was so still i did not know the year then  
in which my call would come  
earlier by the 
dial 
than the rest have gone
it's stiller than the sundown 
it's cooler than the dawn  
the 
daisies dare to come here  
and birds can flutter down so when you are tired or perplexed  or cold  
trust the loving promise 
underneath the mould 
cry it's 
i take 
dollie 
and i will enfold
