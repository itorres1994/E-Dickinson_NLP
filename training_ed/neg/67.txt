67

success is counted sweetest 
by those who ne'er succeed 
to comprehend a nectar 
requires sorest need
not one of all the purple 
host 
who took the 
flag today 
can tell the definition 
so clear of victory
as he defeated  dying  
on whose forbidden ear 
the distant strains of triumph 
burst agonized and clear
