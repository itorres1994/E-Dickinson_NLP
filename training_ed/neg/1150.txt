how many schemes may die 
in one short 
afternoon 
entirely unknown 
to those they most concern  
the man that was not lost 
because by accident 
he varied by a 
ribbon's width 
from his accustomed route  
the 
love that would not try 
because beside the 
door 
it must be competitions 
some unsuspecting 
horse was tied 
surveying his despair
