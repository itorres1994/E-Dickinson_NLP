let 
us play 
yesterday  i  the 
girl at school  
you  and 
eternity  the 
untold 
tale  
easing my famine 
at my 
lexicon  
logarithm  had i  for 
drink  '
twas a dry 
wine somewhat different  must be  
dreams tint the 
sleep  
cunning 
reds of 
morning 
make the 
blind  leap still at the 
egglife  
chafing the 
shell  
when you troubled the 
ellipse  
and the 
bird fell manacles be dim  they say  
to the new 
free  
liberty  
commoner  
never could  to me '
twas my last gratitude 
when i slept  at night '
twas the first 
miracle 
let in  with 
light can the 
lark resume the 
shell  
easier  for the 
sky  
wouldn't 
bonds hurt more 
than yesterday
wouldn't 
dungeons sorer grate 
on the 
man  free  
just long enough to taste  
then  doomed new god of the 
manacle 
as of the 
free  
take not my 
liberty 
away from 
me
