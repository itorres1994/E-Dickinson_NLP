it was not 
death for i stood up 
and all the 
dead lie down  
it was not 
night for all the 
bells 
put out their 
tongues for noon
it was not 
frost for on my 
flesh i felt 
siroccos  crawl  
nor 
fire  for just my 
marble feet 
could keep a 
chancel cool and yet it tasted like them all 
the 
figures i have seen 
set orderly for 
burial 
reminded me of mine as if my life were shaven 
and fitted to a frame 
and could not breathe without a key 
and 'twas like 
midnight some when everything that ticked  has stopped  
and 
space stares all around  
or 
grisly frosts  first 
autumn morns 
repeal the 
beating 
ground but most like 
chaos  
stopless  cool  
without a 
change or 
spar  
or even a 
report of 
land  
to justify  despair
