we learned the 
whole of 
love  
the 
alphabet  the 
words  
a 
chapter  then the mighty 
book  
then  
revelation closed but in 
each 
other's eyes 
an 
ignorance beheld  
diviner than the 
childhood's  
and each to each a 
child  
attempted to expound 
what 
neither  understood  
alas that 
wisdom is so large  
and 
truth  so manifold
