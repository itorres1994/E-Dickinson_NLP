i cannot live with 
you  
it would be 
life  
and 
life is over there  
behind the shelf
the 
sexton keeps the 
key to  
putting up 
our 
life  
his 
porcelain  
like a 
cup discarded of the 
housewife  
quaint  or 
broke  
a newer 
sevres pleases  
old 
ones crack i could not die  with 
you  
for 
one must wait 
to shut the 
other's 
gaze down  
you  could not and i  
could i stand by 
and see 
you  freeze without my 
right of 
frost  
death's privilege 
nor could i rise  with 
you  
because 
your 
face 
would put out 
jesus'  
that 
new grace
glow plain  and foreign 
on my homesick 
eye  
except that 
you than 
he 
shone closer by they'd judge 
us  
how  
for 
you  served 
heaven  
you know 
or sought to  i could not because 
you saturated 
sight  
and i had no more 
eyes 
for sordid excellence 
as paradise
and were 
you lost i would be  
though 
my 
name 
rang loudest 
on the 
heavenly fame and were 
you  saved  
and i  condemned to be 
where 
you were not  
that self  were 
hell to 
me so 
we must meet apart  
you there  i  here  
with just the 
door ajar 
that 
oceans are  and 
prayer  
and that 
white 
sustenance  
despair
