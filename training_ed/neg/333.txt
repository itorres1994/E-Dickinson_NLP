the 
grass so little has to do  
a 
sphere of simple 
green  
with only 
butterflies to brood 
and 
bees to entertain and stir all day to pretty 
tunes 
the 
breezes fetch along  
and hold the 
sunshine in its lap 
and bow to everything and thread the 
dews all night like 
pearls  
and make itself so fine 
a 
duchess were too common 
for such a noticing and even when it dies  to pass 
in 
odors so divine  
like 
lowly spices lain to sleep  
or 
spikenards perishing and then in 
sovereign 
barns to dwell  
and dream the 
days away 
the 
grass so little has to do i wish i were a 
hay
