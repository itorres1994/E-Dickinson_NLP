remorse  is 
memory  awake  
her 
parties all astir  
a 
presence of 
departed 
acts  
at window  and at 
door its 
past  set down before the 
soul 
and lighted with a 
match  
perusal  to facilitate and help 
belief to stretch remorse is cureless  the 
disease 
not even 
god  can heal  
for 'tis 
his institution  and 
the 
adequate of 
hell
