i prayed at first a little 
girl 
because they told me to  
but stopped when qualified to guess 
how prayer would feel  to me  
if i believed 
god looked around 
each time my 
childish eye 
fixed full and steady on his own 
in 
childish honesty and told him what 
i'd like today 
and parts of his far plan 
that baffled me  
the mingled side 
of his 
divinity and often since in 
danger i count the force 'twould be 
to have a 
god so strong as that 
to hold my life for me
till i could take the 
balance 
that tips so frequent now 
it takes me all the while to poise  
and then  it doesn't stay
