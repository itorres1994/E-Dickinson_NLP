me prove it now  
whoever doubt 
me stop to prove it  now  
make haste  the 
scruple 
death be scant 
for 
opportunity the 
river reaches to my feet  
as yet  
my 
heart be dry  
oh 
lover  
life could not convince  
might 
death  enable 
thee the 
river reaches to 
my 
breast  
still  still  
my 
hands above 
proclaim with their remaining 
might  
dost recognize the love
the 
river reaches to my 
mouth  
remember  when the 
sea 
swept by my searching eyes  the last  
themselves were quick  with thee
