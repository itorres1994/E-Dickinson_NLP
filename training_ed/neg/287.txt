a 
clock stopped  
not the 
mantel's  
geneva's farthest skill 
can't put the puppet bowing  
that just now dangled still an awe came on the 
trinket 
the 
figures hunched with pain  
then quivered out of 
decimals  
into 
degreeless 
noon it will not stir for 
doctors  
this 
pendulum of snow  
this 
shopman importunes it  
while cool  concernless 
no nods from the 
gilded pointers  
nods from the 
seconds slim  
decades of 
arrogance between 
the 
dial life  
and 
him
