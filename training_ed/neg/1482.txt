'tis whiter than an 
indian 
pipe  '
tis dimmer than a 
lace  
no stature has it like a 
fog 
when you approach the place  
nor any voice imply it here 
or intimate it there 
a spirit  how doth it accost  
what function hath the 
air 
this limitless 
hyperbole 
each one of us shall be  '
tis 
drama  if 
hypothesis 
it be not 
tragedy
