i reckon  when i count it all  
first  
poets  
then the 
sun  
then 
summer  
then the 
heaven of 
god  
and then  the 
list is done but looking back  the 
first so seems 
to 
comprehend the 
whole  
the 
others look a needless 
show  
so i write  
poets  
all their 
summer  lasts a 
solid 
year  
they can afford a 
sun 
the 
east  would deem extravagant  
and if the 
further 
heaven be 
beautiful as they prepare 
for 
those who worship 
them  
it is too difficult a 
grace  
to justify the 
dream
