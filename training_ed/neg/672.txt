the 
future  never spoke  
nor will 
he  like the 
dumb  
reveal by sign  a syllable 
of 
his 
profound 
to 
come  
but when the 
news be ripe  
presents it  in the 
act forestalling 
preparation  
escape  or 
substitute indifference to 
him  
the 
dower  as the 
doom  
his 
office  but to execute 
fate's  
telegram  to 
him
