the 
morning after 
woe  '
tis frequently the 
way  
surpasses all that rose before  
for utter 
jubilee as 
nature did not care and piled her 
blossoms on  
and further to parade a 
joy 
her 
victim stared upon the 
birds declaim their 
tunes  
pronouncing every word 
like 
hammers  
did they know they fell 
like 
litanies of 
lead on here and there  a creature  
they'd modify the 
glee 
to fit some 
crucifixal 
clef  
some 
key of 
calvary
