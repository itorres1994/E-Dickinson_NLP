1733

no man saw awe nor to his house 
admitted he a man 
though by his awful residence 
has human nature been
not deeming of his dread abode 
till laboring to flee 
a grasp on comprehension laid 
detained vitality
returning is a different route 
the 
spirit could not show 
for breathing is the only work 
to be enacted now
am not consumed old 
moses wrote 
yet saw him face to face  
that very physiognomy i am convinced was this
