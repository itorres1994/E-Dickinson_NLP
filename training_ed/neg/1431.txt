with 
pinions of 
disdain 
the soul can farther fly 
than any feather specified in 
ornithology  
it wafts this sordid 
flesh 
beyond its dull  control 
and during its electric gale  
the body is a soul  instructing by the same  
how little work it be  
to put off filaments like this for immortality
