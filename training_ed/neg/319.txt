the nearest 
dream recedes  unrealized  
the 
heaven we chase 
like the 
june 
bee  before the 
school 
boy 
invites the 
race  
stoops  to an easy 
clover  
dips  evades  teases  deploys  
then  to the 
royal 
clouds 
lifts his light 
pinnace  
heedless of the 
boy  
staring  bewildered  at the mocking sky  
homesick for steadfast 
honey  
ah the 
bee flies not 
that brews that rare variety
