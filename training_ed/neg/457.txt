sweet  safe  
houses  
glad  gay  
houses  
sealed so stately tight  
lids of 
steel  on 
lids of 
marble  
locking 
bare feet out brooks of 
plush  in 
banks of 
satin 
not so softly fall 
as the laughter  and the whisper  
from their 
people 
pearl no 
bald 
death  affront their 
parlors  
no 
bold 
sickness come 
to deface their 
stately 
treasures anguish  and the 
tomb hum by  in 
muffled 
coaches  
lest they  wonder 
why  
any  for the 
press of 
smiling  
interrupt  to die
