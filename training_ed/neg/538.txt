'tis true  
they shut me in the 
cold  
but then  
themselves were warm 
and could not know the feeling 'twas  
forget it  
lord  of 
them let not my 
witness hinder 
them 
in 
heavenly esteem  
no 
paradise could be  
conferred 
through 
their beloved 
blame the 
harm 
they did  was short  
and since 
myself  who bore it  do  
forgive 
them  
even as 
myself  
or else  forgive not me
